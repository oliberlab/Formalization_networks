Urban transformation of the surrounding areas there has been biophysical and demographical changes including changes in governance of the lake, leading to changes in perception of the community residing around the lake. An increase in heterogeneity in the community and actors with varied perceptions and ideas of how a lake should be hampered self-organization. With unplanned urbanization and expanding jurisdiction the city administration as the custodian of lakes has the responsibility to maintain and manage them. The large number of lakes in the city-region is seen as a liability and the city administration is unable to meet the financial requirements needed to maintain the large number of lakes as lake management is not considered in the allocated budgets, nor does the city administration have the required human resource to maintain all lakes in the city. Further, an environmentally aware urban populace of the city are demanding the conservation and sustainable management of lakes. Concerned citizens across the city have worked with the city administration to manage lakes by sharing certain responsibilities. These collaborations formed to address long-standing issues of financing and implementation of day-to-day activities in lake management.
In our case lake (UM), the lake was restored in 2009-10 by the city administration, after which the city administration in 2010 invited a third-sector organization (United Way Bengaluru, UWB) to collaborate mainly in securing finances from private sector in addition to creating awareness among the heterogeneous resident community towards the lake. 
UWB, was an outsider to the locality and had no organizational presence, hence they had to initially build trust among the residents and develop a shared understanding of the importance of the lake to preserving the local ecosystem. During this process of creating awareness and enabling active community participation, UWB established a local community association (Uttarahalli Moggekere Nadigedarara Vedike, UMNV) comprising of interested citizens, which was also made a partner to the initial collaboration in 2017 by signing of a tri-partite agreement. Thus, the responsibilities were further shared with the state providing technical support and enforcement, UWB responsible for financial support and public relations and UMNV responsible to monitoring and implementation of day-to-day activities.

";2;3;Self-initiated by participants;2;3;Off;5;5;Off;Off;5;5;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"There was limited interactions between the actors involved before the collaboration before 2010. UWB, had previously collaborated with the city administration indirectly, to secure finances for managing another lake in the city. There had been limited interactions between the city administration and the resident community along the lake and UWB was a complete newcomer in the area, and had no previous interactions with the local community. 
The city administration invited UWB for partnering with them to secure finances for maintenance of the lake in 2010 and this was an opportune time as UWB was also looking to work on lakes in Bangalore based on previous experience of working with another lake group were looking to work on lakes by themselves and thus were keen to collaborate when asked by the city administration. 
The main incentive for the city administration was lowering of both financial and transaction costs involved in lake management. In the case of UWB, it was establishing itself in the city and had identified lake management in the city as an important issue that the organization would like to involve themselves. Thus, were keenly looking for opportunities to work on issues of lake management. This partnership with the city administration was seen as an opportunity to gain a reputation for the organisation to be recognized and established as one of the key reliable actors not just in the city, but within the locality for lake management. 
Over a period of time, UWB was able to establish itself as a reliable actor for lake management in the locality by building trust among the community, create awareness and organize the community leading to the establishment of UMNV (local community association) in 2017 and involve them as collaboration partners thus ensuring inclusion of community views and perceptions in lake management.

The MoU clearly detailed individual roles and responsibilities, with the city administration providing infrastructural and technical support and UWB  responsible for securing finances and creating awareness among the local residents. With the inclusion of UMNV (local community association) as a collaboration partner in 2017, there was a new tri-partite agreement signed between the three collaborators which clearly layed out the rules in addition to responsibilities of each actor towards lake management. Where the UMNV (local community association) was responsible for mainly for monitoring activities and enforcement of certain activities in consultation with the other two actors.  The city administration and UWB retained their previous responsibilities of providing infrastructural and technical support and securing finances and creating awareness among the local residents for the lake. 
In 2010, when the collaboration was initiated, it was clear that both actors were responsible for certain activities and were in direct contact with each other in case of need. At the start, the collaboration did not include the community, which can be attributed to the heterogeneity and skepticisms of the community towards both the city administration and UWB (which was an outsider to the area).  Over the years, UWB overcame skepticisms and identified interested and key community members who were ready to work with the collaborative partners to shoulder some responsibilities in addition to acting as community representatives who acted as bridges between the larger resident community and the collaboration partners. To formalize the inclusion of community voices, UWB established the UMNV in 2017. 
The decision-making process has always been transparent at least among the collaborators since the beginning of the collaboration. With the signing of the tripartite agreement in 2017, decisions regarding lake management is taken based on discussions and consensus at regular monthly meetings between the three actors.

The city administration took the lead to initiate and establish a collaboration in 2010, with individual responsibilities clearly highlighting individual roles and responsibilities leading to non-infringement of each other’s roles. This open and flexible collaboration based on inclusion and deliberation between the actors. The city administration as the de jure custodian of the lake, has the final say in all decisions, are quite open to discussions and all decisions are based on consensus between the collaborators. 
UWB has been a leader in securing private finances and brining in private volunteers in addition to creating awareness and organising the community for lake management. Under the leadership of UWB, there were several awareness campaigns, activities and workshops to create awareness and build trust within the community members and between the collaborators. These activities established UWB as a key actor who played a bridging role between the city administration and community members and still play abridging role in the collaboration. 
Thus, during the period of collaboration, there has been a shift in the actor leading the collaboration, the city administration which initiated the collaboration in 2010, and UWB which keeps the collaborators together and plays an important bridging role.

The city administration had briefly worked with UWB, who were in collaboration with another lake group in the city. When the city administration reached out to UWB, it was mainly to secure finances and create awareness among the citizens towards lake management. These goals were formulated based on the requirements and strengths of the collaborators. In 2010, the community was highly heterogeneous and with varied perceptions of how the lake should be leading to lack of a common community voice and representation led to lack of organization of the community. Further, the community was skeptical of the city administration mainly as they had seen the lake fall into disuse and deteriorate under state control since the early 90s. With the beginning of the collaboration in 2010, the city administration had collaborated with UWB, which was unknown to the community and was considered an outsider and felt alienated from lake management. 
The outcomes were formulated mainly to increase benefits and reduce costs for all actors involved since the beginning of the collaboration in 2010 and the same was followed throughout the period of collaboration. The main outcome of the collaboration which was to undertake day-to-day activities and ensure lake maintenance and management remained constant throughout the process. This outcome was in-line with the aims and objectives of both the city administration which wanted to ensure lake conservation and increase citizen participation in lake management and UWB which had the organizational mandate to identify innovative solutions to societal issues through private financing. UMNV (local community association) which was established formally by UWB in 2017 was mainly mandated to work on issues of lake management to provide citizens a forum to participate and take an active role in lake management. Thus, the overall outcome of the collaboration remained constant. 
Over the period of time the collaboration became more inclusive of local concerns and issues, especially as in 2010, there was no involvement of the citizens and with the establishment of UMNV and signing of the tri-partite agreement in 2017, there was a recognition and formal inclusion of local community as equal partners in managing Uttarahalli Moggekere lake.

These goals were formulated based on the realization of potential benefits and the organizational objectives of the actors. During the initial stages of collaboration (in 2010), the city-administration and UWB (third-sector organization) shared a common goal and worked towards its achievement, as for UWB it was a matter of building its reputation and establishing itself as a key actor for lake management in the city. For the city administration, this was a matter of ensuring its investment in reviving the lake in 2010 was not wasted in the long-term. The city administration as the government custodian of the lake monitored the activities of UWB, based on the financial support garnered for undertaking activities of lake management. Further, the private companies that provided financial support to UWB under their corporate social responsibility schemes to undertake activities had their own mechanisms of monitoring their support through regular checks and visits to the lake. The community, 
The signing of the tri-partite agreement in 2017, and the inclusion of the community as collaborators led to establishment of a monitoring committee as was stipulated in the agreement. This committee comprised of 2 members representing each of the actors and meet regularly to oversee that each actor discharges their roles and responsibilities as envisaged in the agreement. If any issues are raised at the meetings of the monitoring committee and remedial action is not undertaken within 30 days the actors have the rights to terminate or withdraw from the agreement. Further, the agreement also specifies that if the city administration observes that UWB or UMNV is not discharging their activities, the city administration can terminate the contract with them and the same rights are provided to UWB and UMNV, who can withdraw from the agreement in case they observe the city administration is not fulfilling its stated responsibilities.

The main output for UWB (as this was the first lake they worked on individually) was the development of a blueprint to expand its strategies for lake management based on the lessons learnt on how to work with the city-administration and on gaining trust of the community. 
There were several outcomes produced by this collaboration, namely: securing finances from private companies by UWB since 2010. The creation of a common goal for lake management among a heterogeneous community and the establishment of UMNV (local community organization) in 2017 comprising of interested citizens from the community residing along the lake to be part of the collaboration ensuring the inclusion of citizen perspectives and local voices and knowledge by UWB. This led to the signing of the tri-partite agreement in 2017 highlighting the success of collaboration between state and non-state actors and indicating that if a common goal was established between these actors, a collaborative relationship for the betterment of society could be a possibility in other lakes across the city leading to a win-win situation for all actors involved. Further the collaboration led to UWB gained the reputation and was recognized as a key actor for securing private finances as well as in engaging with local communities by creating awareness and aid in organizing the community towards a societal good. Post this collaboration, UWB partnered with the city administration to work across several lakes in the city. For the city administration the main outcome was reduction in transaction costs and overcoming skepticism that non-state actors can also be part of the solution aiding the government in achieving its objectives. For the community, the outcome was mainly an improvement of their neighborhood, and increase in social interactions in an otherwise heterogeneous community with limited interactions. Further, this collaboration helped the community organize itself to develop a common understanding of various issues in the locality and work towards identifying solutions based on community knowledge.

(b) The Front of Pack food Labelling (FoPL) collaboration was asked to develop an innovative FoPL solution: “one system…that is widespread, simple and interpretive.” The collaboration was asked to move beyond currently proposed solutions, such as the traffic light labelling system (used in the UK) or the multitude of different labels currently in use by the food industry. One working group – the Technical Design Working Group – was asked to identify and assess existing FoPL approaches, and then to develop an interpretive FoPL scheme to be used in Australia. The Implementation Working Group was tasked with developing an implementation framework for the FoPL scheme, including options for different regulatory mechanisms, a monitoring and evaluation plan, and a social marketing strategy. By bringing competing groups together in collaborative co-development of a FoPL approach, there was an implicit aim increasing support for the chosen FoPL scheme by a broad and diverse coalition of actors. There was also an implicit aim for the intervention to have maximum impact, e.g. through pushes for widespread and consistent uptake of the FoPL scheme by the food industry. 

(c) Regarding Q 10: the ambition to create a regulatory framework: while this was a stated aim of the Implementation Working Group, it soon became clear that the collaboration would not determine the regulatory nature of FoPL – that responsibility would rest with the Australian government – although they still developed other aspects of an implementation framework. Regarding Q11: the collaboration was never meant to implement or monitor/evaluate the FoPL scheme, but rather to develop a plan for such things. However, towards the end of the collaboration, there was a shift to a Health Star Rating Advisory Committee, consisting of many of the same members as the FoPL collaboration, which was tasked with implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Because this Health Star Rating Advisory Committee was outside the scope of this case study, the scores do not reflect their follow-on duties. 
";2;2;Externally directed by law or authority;3;3;Off;3;4;3;4;3;2;Off;Off;4;Mostly confident;"(a) There were several coalitions of actors within the FoPL collaboration – in simplified terms, a food industry coalition and a public health/consumer interest coalition. Within the food industry coalition, there was a very strong history of engagement. Within the public health/consumer interest coalition, there was a history of engagement, but not as extensive as the food industry coalition. However, this question was answered looking at the collaboration as a whole. These two coalitions had engaged with each other previously, but through more adversarial means than mutual cooperation. Stakeholders noted the history of unproductive partnerships between the two coalitions, signaling that there was a rather weak, yet existent, history of mutual engagement. 

(b) The Forum on Food Regulation, the authority responsible for setting the policy direction with which food standards must align, determined that the government would be best placed to convene a collaborative FoPL development process. 

(c) Public officials realized that the only way for voluntary uptake of FoPL would be to secure the buy-in of a wide range of stakeholders. As such, they were very dependent on the cooperation of stakeholders. However, the food industry was always of the opinion that they didn’t need input from any other group to determine voluntary regulation. This changed toward the middle/end of the observed period, when the government threatened mandatory regulation, meaning the food industry was more reliant on the collaboration to achieve its goal of avoiding mandatory regulation. The public health group was more mixed – some were highly skeptical of the food industry through the whole process, and thought it was just better to lobby the government for their preferred FoPL, not working with the food industry. There was a stated willingness to collaborate at the beginning of the process, but by the end of the process, some had become incredibly skeptical of the collaborative process, expressing that they should work only within their coalitions to advocate for their preferred positions. Given this, I have put a rank of 3 for the beginning, given the mix of perspectives; a 2 for the middle of the period, given that partway through the process, certain members of the collaboration had become noticeably dissatisfied and began to work more in their isolated coalitions; and a 4 for the end of the period, because in response to the dissatisfaction and waning commitment to the collaboration, the government threatened mandatory regulation, signaling to the group that they needed to work together. 

(d) Addressed in the explanations above.

(e) Note: Q15 (trust): there was historically very little trust between competing coalitions. However, a slightly higher ranking was given because some members of the collaboration signaled that there was some goodwill and trust at the beginning of the process, which diminished going forward.

For example, the collaboration consisted of a project committee, under which there were two working groups. Participants’ roles in these committees and groups was clear. Recommendations were to be passed from the working groups to the project committee, and then from the project committee to the steering committee. Working groups needed to come to an agreement on the recommendation to pass upward, or present the different options if agreement could be achieved. Co-chairs of the working groups were assigned, leaving no ambiguity in terms of formal leadership positions. As another example, it was clear that participants were not to speak publicly about the discussions within the collaboration. This was mostly followed, although there was an instance (toward the middle of the observed process) where one of the participants openly spoke about the disagreements within the collaboration. Other ground rules were unclear, and this ambiguity persisted throughout the collaboration. For example, it was not clear who the ‘final decision-maker’ was, largely due to the fact that this was neither a fully voluntary scheme (i.e. industry as decision-maker), or a government developed policy (i.e. Forum on Food Regulation as decision-maker). There was also ambiguity in terms of what was on and off the table for negotiation. Stakeholders expressed (paraphrased) that there had been no other process that followed this model of Project Committee with two sub-committees, to develop a quasi-regulatory scheme. As a result, the ‘rules’ were not very transparent. Given that there were few explicit rules, there was little application of such rules. 

(b) When asked if the collaborative forum was inclusive, nearly all participants interviewed stated that the relevant people and organizations had been included. Some (food industry representatives), in fact, thought it was too inclusive, and that certain groups should have been excluded. Notably excluded, however, were consumers or members of the public, except through their representation by consumer groups. 

(c) A middle rank was chosen for transparency of decision-making since some decision-making processes were transparent, and others were ambiguous. For example, within the working groups and project committees, all participants engaged in discussion and came to a final agreement or recommendation. In times of disagreement, particularly in the Project Committee, the Chair would listen to the perspectives and at times make a final call. Therefore, decision-making was transparent within these groups. However, as mentioned above, it was not clear how the Steering Committee or the Forum on Food Regulation were making final decisions. Unlike between the Project Committee and Working Groups, there was little communication between the Steering Group/FoFR and the lower groups. As such, participants within the Project Committee and Working groups expressed lack of clarity on how decisions at these upper levels were made.

First was the Chair of the Project Committee, the Secretary of the Department of Health. She was recognized as the primary leader of the whole collaboration. There were also appointed leaders to the working groups – two co-chairs from different sectors for each working group. These individuals served as formal, appointed leaders of the working groups, but also often as leaders of their respective coalitions. Hence, a public official was recognized as the main leader, while representatives from the food industry, civil society groups and public servants served as working group leads.

(b) Questions 32-35 focus in on the leadership of the Secretary of the Department of Health, again, recognized as the primary leader of the collaboration. Given her professional authority and gravitas, she was a respected leader. As one participant stated (paraphrased), ‘no one wanted to get on the bad side of the Department of Health,’ a key motivation of actors to cooperate with the collaboration. In terms of the focus of the collaboration, she had a very clear aim, making it clear that a recommended FoPL scheme would be produced by the end of the collaboration. She kept this focus by ‘striving for bronze,’ or in other words, making the necessary compromises and concessions to deliver the final recommendation.  She was successful in minimizing conflict, using a range of strategies. For example, she ensured that all perspectives were heard, empowering weaker stakeholder groups, fairly adjudicating to ensure that the range of interests was reflected in the final decision. She also used creative solutions, such as appointed co-chairs of working groups from competing coalitions, forcing cooperation rather than grand-standing and positioning.

This helped facilitate trust and knowledge-sharing. However, due to the large size and geographical spread of the collaboration members, the collaboration only met a few times each year. They were well-attended, just not very frequent. 

Re Q 39: Given the closed nature of this collaboration, the process was highly concentrated in that particular collaboration. That said, in the middle phase of the collaboration, food industry representatives targued that industry representatives not in the collaboration were key decision makers, and that a separate, industry process should occur to determine voluntary regulation of FoPL. However, in response to this, the government threatened mandatory regulation, at which point the food industry cooperated and the group remained concentrated. 

Re Q 40-41: The group was not very concerned with fact-finding, as contestation of the facts was a major source of conflict among participating groups. There were some attempts within the collaboration to conduct consumer research to determine consumer response to the proposed scheme. Knowledge sharing was a large part of the dialogue-process, even if the aim was to convince others of certain knowledge. 

Re Q 42: Middle rankings were given for this question because, rather than an ‘alignment’ of interests and values, there was more focus on ‘accommodation’ of interests and values within a single FoPL approach.

Re Q 43: The explicit purpose of the collaboration was to co-design a FoPL scheme to address the problems inherent with the multitude of current FoPL approaches.

These were clearly stated, as discussed in comments above. It is not known how goals were formulated within the collaboration. 

(b) The Forum on Food Regulation was connected to the collaboration, arguably an ‘internal actor’, therefore they were not considered to be an ‘external oversight body’ for the response to Q52. The Project Committee and Working Groups were held accountable to the FoFR. There seemed to be very little opportunity to influence the collaboration as an ‘outsider’. Civil society groups could influence the process through the representatives serving in the collaboration. Citizens had no discernable voice of influence in this process, except what was represented by consumer interest groups. It is not known how much elected politicians influenced this process – the FoFR is a non-partisan body.

In terms of a regulatory framework, parts of this were determined by the Implementation Working Group, but the nature of the regulatory framework was largely decided by the Australian government. In terms of legitimacy and support, as described above, this varied among stakeholder groups and across time. At the beginning, there was some level of goodwill and support for the collaborative process. In the middle, when stakeholders became dissatisfied and began disrupting the collaborative process by using veto points, etc., support was perhaps lowest. By the end, after the government had threatened mandatory regulation, the collaboration did somewhat ‘regroup’ to work towards the final end goal. As an rather unintended consequence, the collaboration was very effective at creating a holding environment to contain the conflict among competing coalitions. However, as mentioned, by the middle of the process, this conflict began to ‘leak’ outside of the coalition. For example, the food industry used strategies to withdraw support and undermine the progress of the collaboration, which led some members of the question the legitimacy of the process.

Q56: By the time the formal collaboration was about to cease, there were already plans for a similar, but different advisory group to take-over the monitoring and evaluation of the implemented scheme (hence, changes over time in Q56).

The organizational issues: The challenge of coordinating multiple actors across multiple jurisdictions. The ash cloud affected multiple jurisdictions (international, European, and national), authorities (International Civil Aviation Organization, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL), the European Commission, the European Council, and national governments and their regulatory authorities among others), and sectors (aviation, travel, tourism, and many businesses dependent on air cargo).

B) In response to the 2010 event there was a need to create a harmonized approach in Europe for how to operate in volcanic ash. In response to the 2011 event there was a need to implement the revised system that was put in place after the 2010 ash cloud crisis.

C)  The ash cloud resulting from the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull in April 2010 caused a massive disruption to air travel and paralyzed the European aviation transport system. In response the EU and national authorities need to improvise a solution to solve the immediate crisis and then once that was resolved collaborate among themselves and international authorities to reform and institutionalize the European air traffic management crisis management system for responding to volcanic ash events.

In response to the eruption of the  Icelandic volcano Grímsvötn on 21 May 2011, EUROCONTROL activated the new European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell (EACCC) and acted as the network manager in operationalizing the revised “volcanic ash contingency plan for Europe” and coordinating the use of the Safety Risk Assessment (SRA) guidelines, based on 3 degrees of ash contamination, to provide guidance for flight operations in affected airspace.";3;3;Externally directed by law or authority;2;3;Off;4;5;4;5;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Mostly confident;"A. The prehistory of the 2010 collaboration: Nine VAACs were established in the 1990s. The European Volcanic Ash Task Force was established in 2005. The Volcanic Ash Contingency Plan, EUR Region was adopted in 2009. EUROCONTROL, the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation, had experience working with national authorities of its 40 member states, the EU, and additional members of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC).

The 2011 collaboration has an important prehistory as a result of the April 2010 ash cloud crisis that resulted from the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull, which caused a massive disruption to air travel and paralyzed the European aviation transport system. This cascading crisis caught authorities by surprise and revealed the need to improve crisis preparedness to deal with the threat of volcanic ash in particular and aviation in general at the international, EU, and national levels. In the aftermath of the event, reforms and policy changes ensued. 

B. The collaboration and the subsequent reforms and policy changes were initiated by the 2010 crisis in which, over an eight-day period from 15-22 April,104,000 flights were canceled, preventing approximately 10 million passengers from boarding their flights . 

The flying bans prompted all the major airlines to loudly accuse the authorities of being overly cautious in using a precautionary approach. The the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Air Carrier Association (IACA), and the Association of European Airlines (AEA) also weighed in and criticized the way the shutdown of European airspace had been handled.
On the 17 April 2010 the European Commission requested EUROCONTROL propose a solution to solve the crisis.

C.Because the 2010 volcanic eruption in Iceland quickly transformed into a complex transboundary crisis with cascading dynamics there was a strong sense of interdependence and a strong incentive to collaborate. Air travel was disrupted until the end of May 2010, when  the last of the European countries fully re-opened their airspace. According to the International Air Transport Association, the financial impact to airlines was estimated at $1.8 billion of revenue loss. Moreover, this crisis this was not merely a problem for the aviation sector; the crisis merged with other problems and quickly morphed from an aviation safety crisis to a mobility crisis to an economic crisis and created problems or raised questions in areas such as health (the respiratory impact of ash and medical supply chains) and environmental risks (food and water quality). 

D. After the 2010 crisis there was considerable reforms and policy change.  In December 2010, ICAO finalized the revision of its “volcanic ash contingency plan” for Europe, including standardized guidelines for the alerting aircraft when eruptions occur, which procedures should be followed, and for the possible closure of airspace. This guidance material, capitalizes on the crisis learning that took place in the Eyjafjallajökull case from 17-18 April 2010 and uses the approach brokered by the European Commission which establishes operational guidelines based on three degrees of ash contamination in the case of future volcanic eruptions. As of regulations issued in April 2012, airline operators have more freedom to decide whether or not to fly in contaminated areas. 
Also, after the crisis the Single European Sky (SES) implementation was accelerated which reorganized European airspace. 
";20+;20+;20+;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;3;Off;4;2;3;4;Off;3;3;5;4;5;Off;4;Off;Mostly confident;"A. For the 2010 ash cloud event: After the European Commission requested EUROCONTROL to propose a solution, on 18 April 2010, EUROCONTROL proposed three options, which were presented in teleconferences of the EUROCONTROL Provisional Council and the European Union Council of Ministers on 19 April 2010. At both meetings the option stipulating that states might allow flight operations in the areas contaminated by the lower levels of ash concentration was adopted. Flights would still not be permitted in the zones of higher ash concentration where a so-called no-fly zone would be declared by states. In addition, EUROCONTROL was mandated to start producing charts with a buffer that would assist states in determining the no-fly zone. On 20 April 2010, the acute phase of the crisis was eased when the decisions taken by the European Union Council of Ministers  and the states were implemented.


For the 2011 ash cloud event: Under the SES all of the EU member states have been organized into nine functional airspace blocks (FABs). This reform has integrated the airspace of Denmark and Sweden under one FAB and created FAB Europe Central which has resulted in the multinational management of the airspace of six countries: Germany, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The SES also includes plans to designate EUROCONTROL as the “network manager,” meaning it would take on the role as the central entity to coordinate European Air Traffic control on a daily basis, as well as taking the lead in coordinating the response to future crisis situations affecting aviation, have been accelerated and a European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell (EACCC) has been established. According to the EU (2011), “the EACCC, when activated, is chaired by the Commission and EUROCONTROL, and includes participation from the EU Presidency, air navigation service providers, airspace users, and airports, as well as other relevant stakeholders as deemed necessary according to the nature of a crisis.” The establishment of EACCC was deemed necessary to address the lessons learned concerning the EU's initial inability to coordinate a response to the 2010 ash cloud event. The EACCC has been charged with finding a new consensus driven and efficient method for addressing the challenges raised by future crises so it can play a larger role in how the system responds to disasters.
 B & C. There was collaborative decision-making in ensuring comprehensive and coordinated actions across a number of aviation domains when dealing with crisis situations. The EACCC was also lauded for playing “a key role in facilitating the coordination and assurance of consistent messages on the crisis status, its management and development amongst the EACCC participants, as well as with the media”. EACCC is chaired by the European Commission and EUROCONTROL and includes participation from the EU Presidency, air navigation service providers, airspace users, and airports, as well as other relevant stakeholders as deemed necessary according to the nature of the crisis.
D. There was significant change in institutional architecture of collaboration for dealing with the 2011 crisis compared to 2010.
";Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;4;5;Off;3;3;4;Off;2;3;Off;Off;3;Off;4;5;Mostly confident;"A. At the outset of the crisis there was a lack of leadership. The 2010 crisis dramatically illustrated that Europe’s airspace and control and coordination system was divided and dysfunctional  The fragmented patchwork of 27 national airspaces resulted in coordination and cooperation problems that saw aviation authorities responding on an individual basis to the ash cloud threat. The lack of harmonized regulations, practices, and procedures resulted in confusion, delays and increased costs. Moreover, the mismatch of decision making capabilities and responsibilities dramatically illustrated the need for improved coordination and collaboration between European and national authorities. 

It became apparent that the crisis would have to be resolved  at a European level. The 2010 crisis was solved due to the leadership of the European Commission (agenda setting leadership), the European Council of Transport Ministers (decision making leadership), and EUROCONTROL (idea-based & operational leadership).

B. The decisions taken by the European Council of Ministers, the procedures establishing new operating thresholds that distinguished between three degrees of ash contamination by EUROCONTROL, and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) release of a safety bulletin describing the improved approach for volcanic ash measures resolved the acute phase of the 2010 crisis. 

EUROCONTROL's leadership in activating and managing the EACCC in response to the 2011 ash cloud event helped to the more successful management of that crisis. The EACCC can be lauded for playing “a key role in facilitating the coordination and assurance of consistent messages on the crisis status, its management and development amongst the EACCC participants, as well as with the media” (Parker 2015).

C. Regarding management of the 2010 and 2011 crises the leadership of EUROCONTROL was key. In the post-2010 reform effort the roles of other actors was also important. After the 2010 event ICAO established the ICAO EUR and NAT Volcanic Ash Task Force (EUR/NAT VATF) which produced an amended ICAO EUR and NAT Volcanic Ash Contingency Plan. ICAO and  EUROCONTROL organized and took part in VOLCEX exercises to test the revised system. Leadership in the EACCC is exercised by EUROCONTROL and the European Commission.

B. As described above, in the acute phase of the 2010 crisis EUROCONTROL was charged with formulating possible solutions, which was then decided on by the Transport Ministers. In the post crisis reform period shared outcomes were produced by a task force and the EU through regulations, the Single European Sky legislation, and the formalization of the EACCC.

C. The process shifted from emergency solution formulated to end the 2010 crisis in which, in the words of the head of the British Civil Aviation Authority, “we achieved what often takes years in 96 hours” to a more deliberative reform process managed by the ICAO and the EU.

As described above, in the post 2010 crisis phase of the crisis the goals of the collaboration were formed through ICAO's International Volcanic Ash Task Force and the EU's reform process. 

B. Because of the complexity of the issues involved the task force established four subgroups of experts from various areas of expertise: • The IAVW Subgroup was tasked to work on the prediction of the ash dispersion. • The Science Subgroup worked on ash detection. • The Airworthiness Subgroup worked on determining the ash thresholds hazardous for aviation. • The ATM Subgroup revised the operational response to the volcanic ash.

On 19 May 2010 the European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell (EACCC) was established for the management of any crisis affecting aviation in Europe. The EACCC is co-chaired by the European Commission and EUROCONTROL and includes representatives of aircraft operators, regulators, air navigations service providers, airports, aircraft manufacturers, the military and ICAO. Depending on the type of the crisis, representatives of other organizations may be invited to join. The EACCC was built on the experience gained from the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 crisis.

The new system was tested with a simulation exercise in April 2011. The simulation involved 77 airlines, 14 air navigation service providers, 10 national regulatory authorities, the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre London (VAAC), as well as the European Commission, EASA, and EUROCONTROL. The volcano picked to simulate the ash cloud was Iceland’s most active volcano, Grímsvötn. The exercise gave participants  a chance to test the revised system and give feedback on what worked well and what did not.

C, This exercise proved to be dress rehearsal for the more effective management of the real eruption of Grimsvötn that occurred only a month later in which the involved actors benefited from the fact that a number of the recommended remedial actions had already been taken  based on the lessons learned from the exercise. 

When Grímsvötn erupted on 21 May 2011, the new system sprung into action. EUROCONTROL activated the new European Crisis Cell (EACCC), acted as the network manager, held five meetings, and established contact with the major airlines, the air navigation service providers, the national supervisory authorities, the EASA, and the VAAC. Through this process the situation was monitored, decisions were made, and a plan was put into place. After the EACCC was activated the vast majority of the European states accepted the Safety Risk Assessment (SRA) concept for operation into medium density areas. However, the same consensus did not exist for areas of “High Contamination”. Nonetheless, the number of states that maintained the SRA approach was slightly higher than those declaring “Danger Areas” and applying a zero flight rate. EUROCONTROL has since flagged this as an open issue that needs to be resolved in the future and noted that “some European States still need to adopt the principle of mutual recognition of safety risk assessment (SRA) for operations in the ash contaminated areas”.";2;4;5;Off;2;4;4;Off;1;4;4;Off;1;4;4;Off;1;4;Off;Off;Off;1;4;4;Off;2;3;Off;Off;2;3;4;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;3;4;2;3;4;2;3;4;1;3;4;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;4;5;1;4;5;1;4;5;Off;Off;Off;2;3;4;2;3;4;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;;1;3;4;2;3;4;3;4;4;1;Off;4;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Mostly confident;"A. The response to the 2010 ash cloud event produced a temporary solution that ended the acute phase of the crisis. After the acute phase, ICAO produced a revised version of its “volcanic ash contingency plan” for Europe, including standardized guidelines for the alerting aircraft when eruptions occur, which procedures should be followed, and for the possible closure of airspace. This guidance material capitalized on the learning that took place in the Eyjafjallajökull case. The implementation of SES further integrated European air traffic management and empowered the EASA, which was given a stronger role in developing and overseeing common safety standards for Europe in the field of air traffic management including rules and guidance with regards to volcanic ash. A EU aviation crisis cell (EACCC) was created. Also annual simulation exercises are now held.

B. The revised system did a much better job of managing the 2011 ash cloud event. The reasons behind  the relative success story of the management of the 2011 crisis include the successful institutionalization of the experiences from 2010 into new guidelines for managing volcanic ash that allowed airspace with lower ash concentrations to remain open for commercial flights, the creation of the EU aviation crisis cell (EACCC) that was able to help coordinate the crisis in real time and coordinate decision making among the responsible authorities, the reduced fragmentation of the system by reorganizing European airspace into fewer functional blocks, and the training and simulation exercises that provided a dress rehearsal for the involved actors just prior to the real event. As a result only 900 flights were cancelled for the first three days of the Grímsvötn crisis compared to the 42,600 flights that were cancelled in the first three days of the Eyjafjallajökull crisis.

C. Due to new regulations (April 2012) airline operators have more freedom to decide whether or not to fly in contaminated areas. This reform emphasizes decentralization and deference to operational leaders. With regards to the air transport system, this case appears to be an example were decision makers successfully translated policy learning into reforms that have now been put into practice, leaving the air transport sector better prepared to respond to future events of this kind. While the major changes and reforms implemented in the air transport sector provide some grounds for optimism concerning crisis induced collaboration and learning, this case also demonstrates the limits of crisis induced change and is also an example that DRR measures can languish on the policymaking agenda indefinitely without resulting in any concrete action or systemic improvement, even in the aftermath of a hazard event.  

In light of the risks of volcanic ash clouds impacting Europe in the future, fundamental questions remain concerning to what extent authorities and society are adequately prepared for the other dimensions and challenges this complex cascading crisis raised, such as the threats to human health and environmental dangers to food and water quality that future ash fallout events could pose, particularly to Northern Europe. Reforms to the air transport system are just one part of creating societal resilience to future ash cloud events and more work remains to be done in other crucial societal sectors.

Collaboration is mandated by a provincial policy with specific operational levels depending on the severity of the emergency. While there is a specific protocol in place (Incident Command System), there were challenges, or organizational issues, with 'control' of the incident moving from local to provincial, with local authorities reluctant to give up control. 
b) Ambitions of the collaboration were to act as efficiently and effectively as possible with desired outputs being very specifically outlined in the ICS (from the provincial perspective - municipal ambitions were not collected in the dataset). Desired outcomes were most obviously to contain the wildfire as quickly as possible and maintain the health and safety of those in the area (residents, emergency support).
c) As described briefly in part (a), the fire escalated quickly so the challenge/issue became much greater over a 24 h period. Everyone's ambition seemed to be the same: to contain the fire; however, the desired configuration of actors involved (especially at what level) was contested. Over time, the municipality became more amenable to a province-led effort but this required some discussion. ";3;3;Externally directed by law or authority;1;3;Off;3;5;5;5;2;4;Off;Off;5;Mostly confident;"a) Participants at the provincial level (from mid-collab to end) had a prehistory and actually engaged in activities designed to build their network in the event that they were in an emergency response situation. However, there was no prehistory between the municipal level actors and the provincial actors, and the municipal actors led the response in the first day or two of the wildfire response.
b) The collaboration was initiated by the ICS protocols (see answer to Q 13). The province became obligated to be involved as the wildfire became larger.
c) The sense of interdependence changed over time. At first, the municipality did not want provincial involvement and pushed back. The province worked to engage the municipality in a way where they still felt as if they held some control. As the provincial actors became more involved, the sense of interdependence increased as the provincial actors are highly reliant on each other for accurate monitoring, reporting and taking actions on a range of fronts from fire fighting to human health to infrastructure issues. 
d) See response to c. ";1-mei;Don't know;Don't Know;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;4;Off;5;2;3;4;Off;1;2;4;5;5;Off;5;Off;Mostly confident;"a) Ground rules of collaboration were established through the ICS for the provincial participants and in their engagement with other levels of government. The ground rules for collaboration with other organizations that were mentioned by study participants but not interviewed were less clear, but study participants did not mention any issues with other organizations (e.g., Red Cross, other aid organizations). 
b) The collaborative forum was not particularly inclusive due to the nature of the problem and its urgency. Collaboration at the provincial level required all ministries to be involved (have an individual in the Provincial Operations Centre at all times) and so in that way it was inclusive. It also allowed for ongoing participation of municipal actors but at a reduced level of engagement in terms of decision making. Provincial actors navigated the strong command-and-control system in place and managed to find ways to maintain a good relationship with municipal actors.
c) Transparency of decision making within the ICS is clear. There are specific roles and a hierarchy and this is followed closely for efficiency. Within this structure, however, study participants indicated that there was room to use pre-existing relationships and get information as needed and tasks accomplished quickly as a result.
d) The architecture did change over time, and quickly, from a muncipal-led endeavour to a provincially-led response. The negotiation of the shift was not entirely smooth.";Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;3;4;4;Off;2;3;4;Off;2;3;4;Off;3;Off;3;3;Reasonably confident;"a) Leadership was largely shouldered by the emergency management teams municipally and provincially. At the municipal level, it was the fire chief and as the fire expanded and became more severe eventually the provincial leader of the Provincial Operations Centre was engaged and oversaw the emergency response, relying on other individuals within the POC to support decision making on a very short timeline. The style of leadership was command-and-control as with any ICS, but the study participants noted that there was still room within that structure for collaboration.
b) Leadership had a substantive influence on the collaborative process, especially in the process of upscaling from municipal to provincial leadership. The municipal leader was reluctant to turn over decision making power to the province and this created tension and some issues with the flow of information. There was a lack of willingness to collaborate across levels. However, over time and as a result of the province deploying an individual to work through that upscaling process with the municipal leader, collaboration between the two levels of government was possible.
c) See (b) for the early and mid-period changes in leadership dynamics. Near the end of the observed period, the POC was operating fully and leading the response.";2;5;5;Off;5;3;4;Off;5;2;Off;Off;2;5;5;Off;Off;Off;5;Off;5;2;2;3;4;Off;Off;5;5;4;4;Off;Reasonably confident;"a) Actors interacted with each other closely, and in the mid- and end-periods of observation this was required to achieve the outputs required each day. 
b) The outputs were largely dictated by the ICS, briefings were required each day at certain times and these supported decision making by leaders. So, a large number of actors contributed to formulating and achieving shared outcomes (reduction in fire size) over time and they worked together both following the ICS closely but also some ad hoc collaboration to ensure the information collected and synthesized and actions taken occurred as efficiently as possible.
c) This process changed from the early period of observation to the mid- and end-periods. In the early period, the municipality was entirely responsible for the emergency response. We do not have a clear picture of what that process looked like.";3;5;5;Off;Off;4;4;Off;Off;5;5;Off;Off;5;5;Off;5;5;Off;Off;Off;5;5;Off;Off;5;5;Off;1;Off;3;3;Off;1;Off;1;1;Off;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Reasonably confident;"a) The goals of the collaboration were set by the ICS and by the leadership at the provincial level. Note that I do not provide answers for the above section in the early period as I cannot be sure how this occurred - we do not have sufficient information to answer these questions.
b) Various groups held the collaboration to account through media and through direct communication with those in the Provincial Operations Centre, however, they did not have any direct influence over the collaboration. Elected officials were briefed each day and provided input.
c)It is difficult to say how these dynamics changed over time, as we do not have sufficient information to establish the responses to the questions above for the start of the observed period.";3;4;4;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;2;4;4;Off;3;5;Off;5;Off;2;3;3;Off;3;5;5;Off;2;4;4;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;2;2;2;4;4;2;3;3;2;5;5;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;3;Off;Off;Off;2;3;3;2;3;3;2;2;2;3;Off;1;1;Off;Off;;4;4;4;3;4;4;3;4;4;3;4;4;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Reasonably confident;"a) The collaboration, throughout the observed period, had very specific results as targets. I define results here as the tangible outputs of the collaboration. In this case, the desired result was to control the fire. The ability to achieve this desired result was influenced by outside forces beyond the control of the collaboration but a high degree of coordination of resources, services and leadership was required to achieve it. Other targets were to protect human health and infrastructure and these were achieved as well due to collaboration among the public officials in charge of the response and other organizations such as the Red Cross.
b) Problem solving was highly dependent on collaboration, as a high degree of information was required and constant updating needed to deal with the fire as it grew and changed. Other problems such as evacuation and safety of first responders was largely dealt with in the start of the observed period and organized at the municipal level with support from other organizations. Based on these observations, goals were achieved (no lives lost directly due to the fire, fire was contained eventually - though this occurred beyond the observed period). The legitimacy of the collaboration may have had a minor impact on outcomes, in the transition from the start to the middle of the observed period in the upscaling phase from municipal to provincial leadership. This was not a smooth transition and there were perceptions that the province was taking over but not wanted (i.e., not seen as legitimate collaborators) by the municipal actors.
c) Since the period of observation was very short (about one week), there was very little change in outputs or social outcomes over time. However, the outputs (i.e., daily reports, etc) necessarily changed in the upscaling process, as different systems were used for emergency management - movement to the ICS system at the provincial level from the middle to the end of the observed period.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This collaborative effort was focused on developing a conservation agreement between private landowners in a ranching community, state agency officials and scientists, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in order to protect the Greater Sage-Grouse, a former candidate for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In exchange for adopting specific conservation strategies, landowners would be protected from additional regulations in the event the bird became federally protected. In this case study, it is notable that normal ranching operations (not including overgrazing) are not considered a primary threat to sage grouse. 
The FWS has been increasingly encouraging a more cooperative approach for the ESA, but many landowners remain skeptical of the agency, which they primarily view as a regulator. This is problematic since many vulnerable species depend on privately-owned land for habitat, and effective conservation for many will require partnerships with landowners. At the same time, the ESA remains contentious, and implementation decisions are frequently subject to a steady stream of lawsuits as political actors seek to achieve their preferred policy outcomes. In response, officials may seek to create “bullet-proof” decisions that will be highly defensible in court—by adhere strictly to existing rules and procedures and carefully documenting the evidence used in each step of the decision. This may prevent decisions being overturned in the courts, it can also lead to lengthy decision timelines and officials that are unwilling to exercise the flexibility and creativity that are critical for effective conservation efforts, particularly when working with private landowners.  

b) The stated ambitions and desired outputs and outcomes

The West Central Local Working Group (LWG) was formed according to Idaho’s 1997 statewide Sage-Grouse Management Plan. LWGs were created as a mechanism for local stakeholders, with financial and technical assistance from the state, to create a sage grouse plan for their associated area. Unlike the areas represented by other LWGs in the state, the West Central is dominated by private property. As a result, LWG members chose to focus their energy on developing a “Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances” (CCAA). LWG members thought a CCAA would provide for a way to support grouse populations while also providing a measure of protection for private landowners who chose to participate. 

c) How did challenges, issues, and ambitions evolved over the period

Over time tensions rose as several landowners felt that agency representatives had taken over the process and that their voices no longer being heard. Officials and landowners repeatedly butted heads over the nature and extent of various threats to sage grouse populations, as well as how the threats should be addressed.  Landowner attendance at meetings declined, and enthusiasm for the project fell. These conflicts came to a head when, constrained by limited time and resources, both the overall CCAA and the Site-Specific Plan for the lead rancher were both nearing their completion. With accusations of deceit and a breach of trust, the rancher abandoned the agreement, and the rest of the community soon followed. While the agreement was formally completed and adopted, no landowners chose to participate in the end.
";3;2;Externally directed by law or authority;3;3;Off;4;4;3;4;2;2;Off;Off;2;Mostly confident;"(a) the prehistory and past interactions of participants

The Idaho Office of Species Conservation (OSC), which worked alongside the state Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) on sage grouse conservation efforts, had previously been involved with creating a programmatic CCAA for the Southern Idaho Ground Squirrel in the same general area. This agreement was adopted by the FWS in 2005, so there is an overlap of landowners who would have been eligible to enroll in both agreements.  The ground squirrel's CCAA had worked well enough to keep that species from being listed, and was popular among the landowners according to the OSC, and there was little conflict involved. Given the dominance of private land in the West Central, the OSC suggested using the same model for the sage grouse in order to provide protections for landowners. A consultant with family ties to the ranching community, who had also worked with many of the interested landowners on previous projects, was hired to direct the process.  The local FWS official involved with the CCAA was well-known and liked among the community. 

(b) how the collaboration was initiated

The LWG structure was initiated by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game as required by its 1997 Sage Grouse Management Plan, in which the state addressed its rapidly declining populations. This plan explains that the first meeting of each LWG would be organized by IDFG and involve a variety of stakeholders, and that each LWG was expected to develop a management plan within a year of its first meeting. The West Central LWG first began meeting in 2003, and the OSC hired a well-known consultant to lead the process. Soon after, OSC recommended that the group consider the CCAA model, to which the LWG participants agreed.

(c) the sense of interdependence between participants and the incentives to collaborate

There is no explicit evidence regarding the level of interdependence among the different groups of stakeholders, although many participants noted that there was a lot of relationship-building that occurred in the first few years of the effort. 

The incentive to collaborate was to gain a degree of regulatory protection for private lands in the event the sage grouse was listed under the Endangered Species Act. This private land agreement was also intended to be linked with a CCA (Candidate Conservation Agreement) to be adopted for grazing allotments on public land later on in the process.

No information.

b) inclusiveness of collaborative forums

The West Central LWG was formally open to anyone who wished to be involved, but specifically, Idaho’s 1997 sage grouse management plan described that, once initiated, each LWG would be organized by an internal leadership team that would include at least one member representing agricultural interests, one from a state or federal land management agency, one from a wildlife conservation organization, and one from IDFG itself. The report indicated that if this leadership team included more than four individuals, it should maintain a balanced membership among those groups. 

c) transparency of decision making within forums

No specific information about decision-making early on in the process, however transparency issues factored in substantially with the ultimate collapse of the effort. While there was general acceptance of the draft CCAA agreement, modifications were made following internal FWS review that the landowners involved felt were made without their input and that they were not provided adequate notice of those changes prior to adoption.

d) any significant changes in institutional architecture over time

Landowner LWG participants complained that over time, the group became increasingly dominated by state and federal agencies. Those interviewed reported that landowner participation declined in response.

While the consultant had expertise in forestry and timber management, he was well-known to state officials and had family ties to the local ranching community. Local landowners were primarily led by one well-respected individual from the ranching community.

As the process continued, there was increasing reliance on this key individual, to whom many looked for an indication of whether or not to trust the process or engage with the FWS. Two additional consultants were hired to provide technical expertise in wildlife and range management. 

Although the lead landowner had begun their involvement as an enthusiastic supporter of the process, as time went on their perspective began to sour. At the end, when there were some significant moments of miscommunication, this individual decided that they could no longer trust the process or those involved. According to some participants, the individual then began to undermine any remaining interest in the program among the community, and ultimately the agreement was abandoned despite being technically complete.

The West Central LWG met regularly, often on a monthly basis. There was an early focus on the legal context and the potential threat of increased regulation, as well as understanding the habitat needs of sage grouse. These conversations were interspersed with CCAA development. There were a number of debates with agency officials and scientists about the threats facing sage grouse, how to measure threats and impacts, and the appropriate manner of addressing them.

A completed CCAA agreement was developed, and the associated FWS permits were issued.

(b) the outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences

Goals for improved sage grouse populations were not met, as no landowners enrolled as participants under the programmatic CCAA agreement. Interviewed landowners as well as state officials recognized that the overall idea of CCAAs had likely lost their earlier appeal, and landowners expressed a deeper skepticism of engaging in voluntary programs with the FWS.

(c) the changes to collective outputs and social outcomes over time

Early discussions focused on how to improve conservation outcomes without substantial impacts to ranch operations. Landowners increasingly felt that consideration for their economic needs were not being accounted for as time went on, and that they were not being listened to by the scientists and agency officials. Landowners, state officials, and hired consultants observed that the growing relationships and trust that had been built early on in the process were damaged by the way the collaboration ended, perhaps irreparably. The FWS contested this conclusion, maintaining that these relationships were largely still in place despite the conflict.

b) The stated ambitions and desired outputs and outcomes

The Harney County CCAA Steering Committee was initiated in 2011 when a group of local ranchers expressed interest in the “Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances” (CCAA) program when meeting with a local extension agent, out of concern for how an ESA listing for sage grouse would impact their operations. The group sought to create a programmatic CCAA that any landowner in the county could participate in, in order to provide an opportunity for protections in the event of an ESA listing, while also contributing towards improved sage grouse populations in the county. Such an arrangement would also support other statewide sage grouse conservation efforts aimed at avoiding the need for federal protections (and the increased regulation those protections would bring) in the first place.   

c) How did challenges, issues, and ambitions evolved over the period

A key challenge encountered by the Steering Committee was deciding how to evaluate and monitor sage grouse habitat. The tools supported by the FWS were highly detailed and narrowly focused on sage grouse. The Committee argued instead for a simpler and more intuitive ecosystem-based model that could be adapted to include other species in the future. All were aware of other local species that would soon be considered for ESA protections, and committee members argued it would be redundant to reinvent the whole process for each. Instead, they advocated for an ecosystem-based framework that could be adapted to meet the needs of additional species as necessary. 

Once completed, members felt the model they had created would be useful beyond Harney County. As a result, members began an outreach effort to promote their CCAA as a framework that balanced conservation goals with the needs of ranching operations. Harney County’s CCAA was soon adapted by all other Oregon counties with sage grouse populations, as well as by the Oregon Department of State Lands. Additionally it was used to inform the development of a public lands conservation agreement between the Oregon Cattlemen’s Association, the Bureau of Land Management.
";4;3;Self-initiated by participants;3;3;Off;4;4;3;4;4;5;Off;Off;5;Highly confident;"(a) the prehistory and past interactions of participants

Many participants cited an earlier collaborative process for the comprehensive plan for the nearby Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as setting the stage for the success of the CCAA, highlighting that relationships forged in that effort helped to reduce the tide of litigation and bolstered stakeholder confidence in the potential benefits of collaboration. An institution that was a key resource for the Steering Committee was the Eastern Oregon Agricultural Research Center. Scientists at the EOARC were trusted members of the community, and as such helped the Steering Committee to work through the relevant research in order to make sense of the different threats facing sage grouse and the value of the conservation strategies that were proposed to address them. In addition, due to overlapping networks, participants in the effort were aware earlier West Central, Idaho CCAA effort. Knowledgeable about the dynamics and failures there, Steering Committee members made clear from the start that while they welcomed input from state and federal agencies, they would not be in charge of the process.

(b) how the collaboration was initiated 

The Harney County CCAA Steering Committee was initiated during a habitat monitoring workshop offered by the local Oregon State Extension agent for landowners (largely ranchers) who were interested in participating in voluntary conservation programs offered through the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Discussion among the ranchers in attendance turned to the idea of a CCAA, and the meeting’s agenda shifted to explore the opportunity and led to the creation of the Steering Committee.

(c) the sense of interdependence between participants and the incentives to collaborate

There was a strong sense of community and interdependence among Steering Committee participants, including a local FWS official, who had grown up nearby and was trusted by many of those involved Participants described a mutual interdependence between conservation for the grouse and the health and resilience of the local community and ranching economy. 
The incentive for community members to collaborate was to gain a degree of regulatory protection for private lands in the event the sage grouse was listed under the Endangered Species Act. State officials valued the opportunity to avoid the acrimonious and lawsuit-filled conflicts that had surrounded many natural resource conflicts in the state. The environmental advocates who participated noted the need to engage with rural communities in conservation efforts rather than against them.

(d) any significant changes over time in the period observed.

None were observed or mentioned by participants.

There is no information available regarding formal, explicit ground rules for the collaboration beyond the Steering Committee maintaining organizational control over the process. This was important to the members of the committee in order to avoid the outcomes that the West Central LWG experienced in their CCAA effort in Idaho.

b) inclusiveness of collaborative forums

The Harney County CCAA Steering Committee, included representation of local private landowners, the Harney Soil and Water Conservation District, state and federal agencies, Oregon State University Extension, The Nature Conservancy, the Eastern Oregon Agricultural Research Center (EOARC), and the FWS. Participants indicated that they would have preferred to have more interests represented, especially among environmental organizations, but noted that it wasn’t always easy to get people engaged. The group engaged in outreach and recruitment efforts aimed at building participation in the development effort as well as enrollment for the eventual agreement.

c) transparency of decision making within forums

The goal of the group was that decisions regarding the CCAA would be made as transparently as possible and with time for substantial debate among participants.

The Steering Committee was chaired by a local rancher, and the Harney Soil and Water Conservation District also played a leadership role as it served as it held the permits associated with the programmatic CCAA. In addition, a board of seven elected officials was gathered to help direct policy discussions, and the primary planning team included a coordinator, a retired ecology from the Bureau of Land Management, and an official with experience with both the SWCD and the BLM. 

(b) the dynamics and impact of leadership on the collaborative process

The Chair of the Steering Committee worked to alert the community in terms of the potential regulatory threat of an ESA listing, after having witnessed the conflicts associated with the Northern Spotted Owl in the 1990s. He sought to work with other organizations and institutions within Oregon to promote greater attention to the problem, and to the CCAA as a potentially valuable tool for assuring landowner security in the event of a listing. With a background in business and having held previous elected positions, this individual felt confident that he could facilitate a constructive dialogue between the local community and outside agencies and stakeholders. Towards the end of the process, the Chair collaborated with officials from the SWCD and NRCS to promote their CCAA model to other counties and organizations within the state, eventually helping to ensure that landowners in all Oregon counties with grouse populations could choose to enroll in a programmatic CCAA.

A completed programmatic CCAA was developed for Harney County, and the associated FWS permits were issued. Additional CCAAs used Harney County’s as a model and were adopted in all counties with sage grouse populations as well as by the Oregon Department of State Lands. The Steering Committee also worked in tandem with the Oregon Cattlemen’s Association, which was developing a partner CCA to cover grazing allotments on federal public lands within the state.

(b) the outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences

Most of the participants viewed the Steering Committee’s work a success which added to the growing support for collaborative processes in the region, and there were no lawsuits filed over the agreement. At least 53 landowners enrolled under the Harney County CCAA, with properties totaling over 320,000 acres. In addition, the popularity of private land conservation agreements such as the CCAA were cited as by officials as part of the reason that the FWS ultimately decided in 2015 that federal ESA protections were “not warranted.”

A completed programmatic CCAA was developed for Harney County, and the associated FWS permits were issued. Additional CCAAs used Harney County’s as a model and were adopted in all counties with sage grouse populations as well as by the Oregon Department of State Lands. The Steering Committee also worked in tandem with the Oregon Cattlemen’s Association, which was developing a partner CCA to cover grazing allotments on federal public lands within the state.

(b) the outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences

Most of the participants viewed the Steering Committee’s work a success which added to the growing support for collaborative processes in the region, and there were no lawsuits filed over the agreement. At least 53 landowners enrolled under the Harney County CCAA, with properties totaling over 320,000 acres. In addition, the popularity of private land conservation agreements such as the CCAA were cited as by officials as part of the reason that the FWS ultimately decided in 2015 that federal ESA protections were “not warranted.”

This collaborative effort was focused on developing a conservation agreement between private landowners in a ranching community, state agency officials and scientists, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in order to protect the Greater Sage-Grouse, a former candidate for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In exchange for adopting specific conservation strategies, landowners would be protected from additional regulations in the event the bird became federally protected. In this case study, it is notable that normal ranching operations (not including overgrazing) are not considered a primary threat to sage grouse. 
The FWS has been increasingly encouraging a more cooperative approach for the ESA, but many landowners remain skeptical of the agency, which they primarily view as a regulatory entity. This is problematic since many vulnerable species depend on privately-owned land for habitat, and effective conservation for many will require partnerships with landowners. At the same time, the ESA remains contentious, and implementation decisions are frequently subject to a steady stream of lawsuits as political actors seek to achieve their preferred policy outcomes. In response, officials may seek to create “bullet-proof” decisions that will be highly defensible in court—by adhere strictly to existing rules and procedures and carefully documenting the evidence used in each step of the decision. This may prevent decisions being overturned in the courts, it can also lead to lengthy decision timelines and officials that are unwilling to exercise the flexibility and creativity that are critical for effective conservation efforts, particularly when working with private landowners.  

b) The stated ambitions and desired outputs and outcomes

The FWS aimed to create a programmatic sage grouse CCAA would cover any rancher in the state who wanted to enroll, and to do so in a collaborative manner. In addition, participants wished to develop a companion Candidate Conservation Agreement (CCA) that would apply to grazing allotments on public land.

This would provide an opportunity for regulatory protections for ranchers in the event of an ESA listing, while also contributing towards improved sage grouse populations and statewide efforts aimed at avoiding the need for federal protections (and the increased regulation such protections would bring) for sage grouse. 

c) How did challenges, issues, and ambitions evolved over the period

N/A
";3;3;Self-initiated by participants;4;4;Off;4;4;4;4;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Highly confident;"(a) the prehistory and past interactions of participants

This collaboration emerged from an earlier effort by the governor to develop a programmatic CCAA that would cover multiple industries in the state, and so there was some overlap of participants between the two efforts. This effort collapsed under the degree of complexity involved, and the state turned the bulk of its conservation attention to the oil and gas industry, which accounts for 90% of the state’s revenue. 

In addition, from a population standpoint, Wyoming is a small state, and so many of the key participants are likely to have worked with each other in the past on other projects.


(b) how the collaboration was initiated 

 There was an existing interest among state and federal officials in providing some form of protections for the ranching community in the event there was an ESA listing, since the needs of other industries would be addressed by the state in it's conservation strategies. When the governor's earlier CCAA effort collapsed, the project of creating a renewed CCAA effort was handed over to the Wyoming FWS office. At the same time, members of the ranching community were the most vocal about being involved, so FWS chose focus exclusively on the grazing industry in this iteration. At the time, the idea was to tackle a CCAA for grazing first, and then the agency could move on to other industries.

(c) the sense of interdependence between participants and the incentives to collaborate

Participants recognized the value that the regulatory stabiliy that a CCAA (and an associated CCA for public lands) could bring, as well as the conservation value of engaging landowners in habitat conservation. Overall, there was a palpable sense of duty among state and federal participants to work constructively with landowners as valued members of the community and to provide a degree of regulatory protection for them in the event of a listing.

The process was primarily led by the Wyoming office of the FWS, with help from representatives from the Wyoming Stock Growers Association and the Wyoming Association of Conservation Districts. One FWS official described placing a large priority on building relationships and trust, noting that the FWS does not have the greatest reputation among landowners. There was a priority on discussing issues until they could develop an agreement that people would be willing to sign onto, and that effectively reflected participant needs and perspectives. This sentiment was echoed by a participating grazing representative.

b) the dynamics and impact of leadership on the collaborative process

The continuing engagement of the Stock Growers Association seems to reflect the overall ability of the FWS officials to create an environment where organization was comfortable participating. The Stock Growers Association remained involved with the CCAA development and were willing to work with the FWS on outreach efforts regarding the agreement. Their representative described  being eager to inform members about possibly useful tools (although they would not promote participation). Notably, this same organization filed lawsuits against other federal agencies (the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service) tasked with sage grouse management on public lands soon after those plans were published in 2015.

a)  CDL is a policy instrument that involves placing a mandatory deposit on certain (usually beverage) containers to encourage consumers to return them for reuse, recycling or disposal. The capacity and effectiveness of CDL to reduce litter and increase recycling rates is highly contested. Critics argue that CDL only addresses recyclable drink cans and bottles made from aluminium, glass, plastic and steel, which in Australia account for around 10% of the waste stream and 33%  of the litter stream. The potential impact of CDL in NSW on recycling and litter rates is complicated because most cities and regions have an extensive kerbside recycling services for household waste (funded by government through land rates). The vexing questions for policy makers in this context is: a) would CDL bring any additional benefits to its citizens and environment, and b) could CDL work alongside existing kerbside recycling services? 

b) In 1999, the NSW Minister for the Environment commissioned Professor Stuart White (from the University of Technology, Sydney) to conduct an independent inquiry into CDL. White’s task was to assess the costs and benefits of CDL to NSW. His assessment would be the first in Australia to draw on new local data on the environmental costs and benefits of recycling. White also expanded the Review to consider community impacts of CDL especially with respect to cost, access and equity. To this end White (and his team) undertook an extensive social research which included:  
1. interviews with stakeholder groups (one on one) to better understand the perspectives of key groups affected by, or interested in CDL
2. public submissions from 'organised and articulate' groups and members of the public
3. a two-staged public opinion poll (a 'televote') 
4. a citizens' jury with randomly selected citizens 
5. a Stakeholder Reference Group to engage key stakeholders in the design and outcomes of the social research  
6. an Advisory committee to guide the entire social research of the Review 

This case study focusses on the Stakeholder Reference Group (SRG), the most collaborative component of the Review's social research. 

c) In this case the collaborations collapsed after four SRG meetings because key industry groups decided to withdraw their participation and support for the Review. Rather than collaborate, industry groups actively lobbied the commissioning Minister and eventually the Premier of New South Wales. Following these strategic efforts, rumors circulated in the media that the Premier had made a decision not to introduce CDL - news that deeply undermined the ongoing work of the Review. Why analyze the costs and benefits of CDL, and explore citizens preferences thereon, for a policy instrument that the Premier is alleged to have said he would never consider? 

In the end the CDL Review went ahead, but without the support and legitimation of crucial industry groups. In 2002 the government released White's report which found that CDL would bring net environmental and social benefits to NSW. Almost two decades later, in 2017, the NSW government finally introduced a statewide CDL scheme to reduce growing volumes of recyclable containers going to landfill. ";5;1;Independently convened by a third party;1;3;Off;5;3;1;1;3;2;Off;Off;1;Highly confident;"a) Though CDL is widely applied throughout Europe, it has been the subject of significant controversy in Australia since the 1970s. The debate is highly polarised with environmental groups and local governments in favour of CDL and the packaging and beverage industry vehemently opposed to it. Both sides of the debate lean heavily on environmental arguments as well as self-funded research to justify their position. Both set of groups share similar values on the broad goal of waste minimisation (the ends), but have different strategies (interests) in how to reach this goal (the means). 

Prior to CDL Review most key stakeholder groups associated with waste issues in NSW were members of the governments State Waste Advisory Committee (SWAC), which was established in the mid-1990s to advise the the government on waste and recycling issues. SWAC brought together the key stakeholders including representatives from the beverage and packaging industry; environmental groups; local government and consumer groups. Interviews reveal that prior to the Review, SWAC members were highly dissatisfied with SWAC’s procedures and progress. It had functioned with no independent facilitator and all members had strong competing agendas. By the time the Review arrived in 2000, SWAC members were at loggerheads. 

b) The collaborative process in this case was embedded in a legislated inquiry into a policy instrument that industry groups vehemently oppose. Up until 2000 the New South Wales (NSW) government has continuously rejected proposals for CDL and preferred to take a more voluntary approach to regulating packaging waste. However when the relevant waste management legislation (the 1995 Waste Act) came up for formal review in 2000, the performance of industry’s voluntary approach was not convincing, and the NSW Government was formally required to consider alternative policy instruments, such as CDL, to meet it waste reduction targets.  Since the NSW government had opposed CDL in the past and showed an on-going preference for voluntary type policies, it had to build credibility by outsourcing the CDL Review CDL to an external independent expert, Professor White.

c) Interdependence between polarised groups associated with CDL is very low. Since the 1970s there has been a continuous tug of war between competing groups. Positions are deeply entrenched, actors are highly choreographed and the arguments are well rehearsed.  Exchanges between opposing parties have largely involved firing-off report after report, each documenting the results of a ‘study’ commissioned to support their agenda.  On the rare occasions when representatives from relevant groups were brought together, their discussions were not oriented towards reaching common ground. 

d) White's CDL Review attempted to engender a more collaborative approach to discussing waste policy in NSW. However the social research aspects of the Review were not well received by groups on either side of the debate. Industry representatives were concerned that the participants in the citizens' jury would not be able to appreciate the complex economic arguments surrounding CDL. In the end industry groups were so sceptical of the SRG process, and the value of additional public input on CDL, that they withdrew their participation and support for the entire Review. In the end their veto position left them exposed to strong public criticisms that they were unwilling to engage with deliberating citizens and the broader Review.

The Review team recognized early in the planning stages that collaboration and participation were novel in waste policy in NSW and so they actively reached out to key interest groups to support and advise the Review's social research processes. Two external committees were established with the intention of artificially divorcing ‘content’ and ‘process’ issues:

1. a Stakeholder Reference Group (SRG) a ten-member committee composed of all the major interest groups associated with waste issues in NSW, except Choice (formerly the Australian Consumers’ Association). The primary aim of the SRG was to provide input into the material prepared for the participants in the televote and the Citizens’ Jury. The SRG group met on four occasions over a two-month period in the lead up to the televote and the citizens’ jury.  

2. an Advisory Committee (AC): a six-member committee composed of academics and practitioners of public participation to advise on novel participatory aspects of the Review's social research, especially the televote and the Citizens' Jury.

Both committees had clear ground rules and members were given guidelines on their remit.  However, because the committee never met together there was no opportunity for face-to-face dialogue between them. Interviews and observations by the author reveal that Members of the Stakeholder Reference Group (SRG) felt undermined by the AC and at one stage refused to accept their decision as process advisors. Likewise members of the AC found many of the SRG demands unreasonable.  Meanwhile the Review Team served as a conduit for communicating concerns back and forth. 

Outside the SRG meetings industry groups used their resources to build solidarity and collectively lobby against the Review. They set out en masse to criticise the methodology and the competence of Professor White and his team. They also lobbied various Ministers and eventually the Premier of NSW - who is alleged to have reassured industry that CDL would 'never' be introduced. Ten days before the citizens’ jury industry groups announced their withdrawal from the SRG and the Review. 

Notwithstanding these events the Review and the citizens' jury continued with the support of Minister for Environment.  Due to withdrawal of industry group, the citizen jury design was  modified;  various perspectives of the CDL debate were presented by government officials and academics (rather than by representatives of key interest groups as is standard).  The deliberations were affected by these amendments to the extent that citizens were frustrated at not being able to directly interact with key stakeholders at question time.

In establishing the CDL Review, the Minister effectively released himself (at least temporarily) from having to take any leadership on the contentious CDL policy (which had plagued state politics for over 30 years).

The Minister appointed Professor Stuart White from the University of Technology, Sydney to undertake the independent Review into CDL. Leadership, thus, in this case was transferred over to an independent non-government expert. 

The central task of White's Review was epistemic - to undertake an assessment of the economic and environmental costs of CDL. But White recognised the political and social aspects of CDL and convinced the Minister that his Review also needed to research the social and community impacts of CDL.  Under White's leadership the Review actively engaged key stakeholder groups in the Review process, and adopted participatory approaches which were highly innovative and radical at the time, including a televote and citizens' jury, to explore citizen and consumer preferences on CDL.  

White's participatory leadership style was not welcomed by the bureaucracy. As one senior bureaucrat explained:  ""We wanted a detached examination of the issue...an objective reasoned analysis..... It’s ironic frankly – we wanted a fair dinkum analysis in a reasonably unencumbered way but what encumbered it in the end was this desire to consult left, right, and centre."" 

White's attempt to lead a more collaborative and participatory form of policy inquiry was undermined by the actions of pressure groups opposed to CDL - namely, powerful industry associations and beverage corporations. Although these groups actively participated in the initial collaborations (via the Stakeholder Reference Group), they vetoed the Review to undermine its integrity and legitimacy. Industry groups also used their connections and economic power to successfully access the NSW State Premier (the most powerful political position in state) and thereby directly undermining the leadership of White and the authority of the Minister of the Environment. 

Little or no leadership was exercised in this case by public administrators.  As an independent inquiry, the Review carried expectations from public administrators within the commissioning Minister’s office that it would be an objective and impartial assessment of the scientific facts of CDL. The final report was to be definitive, drawing on a technical analysis of the economic and environmental costs and benefits of CDL. Though most of the Review methodology accorded with these expectations, the social research component and its attempt to drive reform through collaboration and public engagement, stirred up what the bureaucracy (and the Minister) was seeking to avoid – politics. ";4;3;1;Off;5;5;3;Off;1;2;1;Off;3;1;1;Off;3;1;1;Off;1;2;4;1;1;Off;Off;1;1;1;1;Off;Highly confident;"
The collaborative elements of this case were well-intentioned in its design, for example in the establishment of the Stakeholder Reference Group, but difficult to realize due to the extremely politicized nature of CDL as a policy instrument. 

Consider for example the interactions between members of the SRG which met to collaborate on four occasions over a two-month period in the lead up to the televote and the citizens’ jury. To the surprise of the Review Team (White and his colleagues) the first meeting was greeted with enthusiasm and cooperation. However by the fourth meeting the communication between parties had degenerated into scepticism and resistance. Instead of focussing on the preparation of materials for the televote and citizens’ jury, the SRG turned into a combative session between the CDL opponent and proponent coalitions.  In particular, industry groups attempted to steer the research in their favour by making requests to amend the briefing materials and the televote questionnaires. Although the Review Team made several changes in response to their concerns, industry groups continued to influence proceedings, for example, by seeking to stall the SRG meetings at critical decision points.  Despite these attempts, the SRG managed to get agreement on contentious background material for the Televote, the Citizens’ Jury, and the Citizens’ Jury program.

Outside the SRG meetings industry sought to actively undermine the work of SRG and the credibility and purpose of the broader CDL Review.  For example, some industry groups criticized the collaborative and participatory methodology, and the competence of the research team. 

Just before the citizens' jury, industry groups demonstrated just how far they would go to undermine the Review and pursue their own interests. On the 21st December 2001, it is alleged that a delegation of key industry representatives met with the Premier, and the Director-General of the Cabinet Office to discuss CDL. At this meeting the Premier is said to have ‘emphatically ruled out CDL as an option for NSW’. According to another industry source, the Plastics and Chemicals Industries Association: ‘The Premier directed the Cabinet Office to write to the Minister for the Environment immediately, indicating that Government policy was opposition to Container Deposit Legislation, on the grounds that it threatened successful kerbside systems and that the Inquiry should close.’ 

Collaboration in this case was doomed from the start. Particularly significant was that groups opposing CDL viewed the entire Review as a conspiracy against their interests. It was, after all, investigating an issue that they had managed to keep out of litter and waste policies for several decades. The Review was not only going to unpack and test their arguments, but it could expose and threaten their control over the issue.  In terms of game theory the stakes were high and industry groups had a lot to lose. From this perspective it is no surprise that they entered the Review process on the defensive facing uncertain outcomes. They then made strong claims that the process was biased and stacked against their interests. By lobbying in and around the process they strategically set out to squash any attempt to create dialogue and open up the issue. Despite several alterations to the process to appease their concerns, resistance continued. This suggests that any objective policy assessment on CDL   – collaborative or not – would have been considered flawed by industry.

It was never a stated aim of the Review to build collaborations and engage multiple stakeholder in joint reforms. 

The collaborative failings at the heart of this case, ie. the withdrawal of industry groups from the SRG and the Review, were never held to account, nor did they attract significant political or public attention.  Interestingly it was the citizens in the citizens' jury that were most disappointed that relevant stakeholder groups were not willing to participate constructively, 
as the following comments demonstrate: 
• I would have liked them to be there. It probably would have made the decision harder but they would have added to the discussion.
• I was disappointed to hear no one from the manufacturers or even the greenies, I don’t know if it would have affected the outcome but we would have gone away feeling that we really had weighed the pros and cons.
• Our conclusions put the onus on industry. They should have been there. 

Many actors interviewed for this case commented that the entire Review process was conducted under the veil of political naïveté. As one civil servant put it:
""Perhaps it was also naïve of the Government to believe that industry and environment groups would have rationally used this opportunity to seriously look at the issue rather than stick with their 10, 15, and 20 year old prejudices – which was all that ended up getting an airing"". 

Others suggest that the organisers could have been more politically savvy, for example, by convincing key actors that there was much to gain by their participation. Furthermore, the  collaborative and participatory aspects of this cases were very low profile with no media involvement and minimal interest from the public. This was an intentional decision by the organisers in conjunction with the Ministry and the stakeholders before they withdrew. But the desire to avoid a media circus in the end served industry groups and the NSW Government well. Neither were called to account for their actions: industry for their withdrawal from a consultation exercise, and government for their decision to go against the findings of the Review.

That said the participatory aspects of the Review - especially reaching out to include the perspectives of affected citizens via a citizens' jury -  generated important insights into community views on a complex policy issue where citizens and consumer perspectives can differ. 

The broader CDL Review (conducted by Professor White) has had policy impact, albeit via long and circuitous route. It generated a significant body of independent research on the potential economic, environmental and social impacts of CDL in NSW. The White report was released by the NSW Government as part of a broader report into Extended Producer Responsibility in February 2002. White's key finding was that CDL would be of net financial, environmental and social benefit to NSW. The social research demonstrated that there is strong community support for CDL provided that issues of equity and access are taken into consideration. An international study released around the same time also supported White’s conclusions: that deposit refund systems are one of the most effective means for achieving high container recovery rates. These findings generated considerable media attention and public discussion.

After the completion of the Review, the NSW Government decided that the CDL issue required national consideration and referred it onto the Federal Government. While the White Report had little direct impact after its release on waste policy in NSW, its findings sparked much interest in CDL in other jurisdictions around Australia including the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia and Queensland. 

Despite ongoing resistance from industry groups, the NSW government finally introduced a CDL scheme (""Return and Earn"") in December 2017 - a full 17 years after it Commissioned the White Review. This policy shift in waste management in NSW has been welcomed by CDL proponents, including local government and  environmental groups, who were central participants in the SRG collaborations. According to one group: ""We are relieved that we have made it to this point when many told us it would never happen.""

Stretching back to the mid-19th Century, traditional, extractive resource use and development by private landowners (ranchers, farmers, and timber companies) and public agencies (US Forest Service; Bureau of Land Management), and increasing recreation demands had significantly degraded a wide variety of natural resources and impaired the ability of the broader ecosystem to function in a healthy, sustainable manner.  As a result, by the late 1980s, the Blackfoot watershed was home to many threatened and endangered species (i.e., Bull trout, grizzly bears, wolves, Canadian lynx, Westslope cutthroat trout [some were listed later than the late 1980s]), and was encountering severe problems with dewatered streams, substandard water quality, invasive noxious weeds, and other signs of deteriorating ecosystem health.

The large number of command-and-control, single issue (fragmented) policies state and federal environmental policy initiatives passed in the 1970s and 1980s, and the litigation that was a common response, failed to stop the broad-based degradation.  The legislation and litigation also contributed to higher operating costs for farmers and ranchers, and increased polarization and distrust among private landowners, government regulators, environmentalists, and other stakeholders.

In addition, the scientific databases capable of understanding and monitoring the nature and extent of the relationships between the multiple resource issues either did not exist, or, if they did exist, were woefully incomplete, were fragmented and specific to the proprietary needs of the major public and private landowners in the area, or were based on incompatible scientific protocols.

Finally, the Blackfoot watershed faced the kinds of new development pressures capable of transforming the rural, rustic character of the area.

(b) the BC managerial strategy embraces a clear mission that is holistic, comprehensive and focused on “taking care of the valley watershed for the long-term” (Personal Interview, 2008). The mission is comprised of a substantive commitment to cooperative conservation. Cooperative conservation for the BC means maintaining and enhancing “environment, economy and community such that no one piece is favored over another. They all must be healthy if this is going to work” (Personal Interview, 2006). The mission is coupled with a strong commitment to “doing good things” for the community. “If you keep on doing good things--and we have—and take on projects that are near and dear to the hearts of Blackfoot community members, it is easier to keep going.""

(c) Getting started -- (pre-formal group starts in 1990) 1993-1994 -- The original Executive Director had expertise in building trust and “reputation for fair dealing;” were good fits when primary tasks were mission development, a set of ideas/vision for the community, and building positive, trust-based relationships among diverse stakeholders.

Phase II -- 1995 - 2000 -- collecting scientific information on watershed conditions, and designing and implementing a handful of programs to improve those conditions.

Phase III -- 2000 - 2008 -- transitioned to successful manager of public organizations and non-profits with clear experience growing and developing organizations, strong on program implementation (and big projects, multiple ongoing at any one time) and fundraising.

(b) Initiated by rancher and environmental regulator (USFWS). In 1990, Greg Neudecker, a scientist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) with responsibilities for endangered species recovery, came to the Blackfoot Valley in western Montana. Jim Stone, the owner of Rolling Stone Ranch, was a third generation Montanan and rancher seeking to maintain his livelihood and the property bequeathed to him by his father. He had virtually nothing in common with Neudecker other than a mutually shared suspicion of one another and frustration with the status quo--the damage being done by the seemingly intractable series of difficult, interconnected, and relentless public problems common to many rural Western landscapes. In fact, each had come to the same conclusion--the environmental and economic sustainability of the 1.5 million acre watershed was being seriously threatened. For Stone, it was all about “his place and the home for future generations of Stones.” For Neudecker, it was about finding a way to discharge his ESA responsibilities successfully in hopes of moving up the management ladder inside the USFWS.

(c) Yes, see Stone and Neudecker agreement above on strong sense of interdependence; neither can achieve their goals without the other; as the ""new ideas"" for what their community could be were developed in 1991 through 1993, more stakeholders joined and sense of strong interdependence felt by others. Then, programmatic successes from early information gathering, mapping and pilot programs implementation demonstrated how the holistic approach could deliver positive, desired results across the broad swath of environment, economy and community--this confirmed/strengthened sense of interdependence.

The broader environment within which the various Blackfoot watershed stakeholders found themselves at the end of the 1980s/early 1990s created significant incentives for change.  This was due to the high problem severity--degradation was severe, obvious, and negatively affected stakeholder ability to maximize their self-defined goals—and the wicked, cross-cutting, interdependent character of the problems.

(d) Significant, positive increases in trust, growth of collaborative Blackfoot Challenge to include more than 160 partners helping to accomplish the tripartite env/econ/community mission, tremendous success in achieving goals have all combined to establish the BC as a critical, if not ""the"" critical problem-solving governance institution for this area of Montana.";6-okt;20+;20+;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;5;Off;5;4;5;5;Off;3;4;5;5;5;Off;5;Off;Highly confident;"(a) Early years (1991 - 1993) -- collaborative stakeholders coalesced around a particular set of ideas. These new ideas, or shared norms, for understanding public problems, the community itself, and the relationships among competing ideas, interests, actors, and sectors of society, were essential to the institutional change process (see also North 2005, 1-6; Hayek 1952).   Taken together they became a broad conceptual framework for guiding stakeholder interaction as stakeholders discussed and attempted to manage and resolve the public problems facing the Blackfoot watershed.  These norms were not written down, rather they served as an informal set of rules emphasizing the shared values and understandings of their “place”—the Blackfoot watershed--that then defined the parameters, hence the constraints and outer limits of the collaborative’s problem solving efforts.  The idea-based foundation succeeded in enveloping, or cosseting, the inevitable self-interest of diverse stakeholders. It also succeeded in framing, or constraining, the behavior and messages conveyed by entrepreneurial leaders and other stakeholders by emphasizing common ground and offering a conceptual outline of what was acceptable and what was not.  In turn, this “framing” decreased the risks (hence uncertainty) associated with participant behavior within the collaborative, thereby fostering trust, the sharing of private information so critical to enduring and innovative solutions, and the willingness to sacrifice, if necessary, some personal gain for the collective good of the watershed and its inhabitants.

Formal 501(c)(3) non-profit formed in 1993. I do not know the formal rules for governing stakeholders interaction from this point forward.

(b) broad inclusiveness is the rule -- from the start a cross-section of interests and organizations involved--ranching, local private businesses, federal and state agency officials. Consistent strategic recruitment, and addition to membership rolls, of “focal” people (influencers). These are the “respected opinion and community leaders,” some without official or formal organizational leadership portfolios, as well as agency officials, who “know their communities inside and out.""  As noted previously, by end of 1990s, had working relationships and involvement in collaborative gov. arrangement of 160 different partners/groups/organizations.

Meet at least once monthly, meetings open to anyone, meet socially at their annual community BBQ, and, with massive projects (e.g., Blackfoot Community Forest Project) meet weekly with the community over an extended time (153 weekly meetings on this project). Also regularly hosts stewardship outreach (workshops), demonstration projects, and watershed/community tours (6 to 8 each year), while an extensive Education and Outreach program involving hundreds of schoolchildren is used to teach citizens the value of a cooperative conservation approach (Ash Institute, 2006). In many years since 2000 they have had more than 2000 citizens participate annually in BC meetings/projects out of the watershed total of 8000.

(c) Strong commitment to transparency; practice consistent with this commitment. Is one of six components of overall managerial strategy. Meetings open to all and/or find out what is going on and what decisions have been made and what projects are ongoing and where.

(d) Main change in instl. architecture occurred when switched in 1993 from informal collaborative focused on building a foundation of common/shared meaning or vision for the watershed into a formal 501(c)(3) non-profit.

And display a “lead from behind, no one is in front, team first” philosophy attracts “the right kind of person who is better suited to working together for others benefit, can bury their ego, and not worry about whether their name is the one in lights. This helps facilitate our problem solving because we focus on the facts and results, and who can help, not on who gets the credit.""

(b) Leadership has arguably been the driving force for the success of the BC over the years. Importantly, the two co-chairs, Jim Stone (3rd generation rancher) and Greg Neudecker (USFWS) have been same up through 2008 (end of period studied).  But there is also the ""multiple entrepreneurs"" dynamic that is key from the start and that grew stronger over time.  These leaders include, among others, Stone and Neudecker, and an ex-state of Montana forester with ample experience within the University of Montana system, a local guest ranch owner, and leaders of the local Trout Unlimited and Nature Conservancy civil society group chapters.  These entrepreneurial leaders clearly helped to establish the initial collaborative efforts in the Blackfoot.  Such leaders also were instrumental in cajoling and persuading self-interested, rational stakeholders to stick with the collaboration long enough to reap better individual as well as collective benefits through the 1990s and into the 2000s.

And has an active pragmatic, hands-on board of directors who are “the heart and soul of the BC, they live it every day. They buy into and practice the mission, the ideas, leadership philosophy and do not turn everything over to staff, which is more typical” (Personal Interview, 2008). Moreover, stakeholders describe Board members as “fully rooted. They live on the land, rely on the land, manage the land whether because they own it or, as government employees, they have a responsibility for it. They do not see their place as an intellectual position; instead they live and breathe the land. They love the place” (Personal Interview, 2008). In addition, BC Board members are leaders in their own right. “Members have their own clear, strong track records of success in various fields and are willing to apply them on behalf of the larger watershed community” (Personal Interview, 2006). Moreover, the hands-on style of the Board “is critical come transition time. If a collaborative is too dependent on staff for direction and programmatic success, then it is problematic for the Board to insert themselves assertively as needed when it is time to change, or to adopt a new way forward in terms of staffing needs.""

(c) 3 Phases of leadership at BC Director (staff) level -- 1st was deeply rooted community member, Psychologist by training with strong reputation as trustworthy and practiced at facilitating trust-building and relationships. 

BC decided that Phase II ""required a good program manager with considerable technical expertise"" given the overarching focus on program design and implementation to improve watershed conditions. This leader also had an established network of state and federal contacts, and a successful record working with government agencies in the water resource and stream restoration arenas.

Phase III -- Director was a successful fundraiser and experienced professional manager clear with track record of growing and developing organizations, strong on program implementation.

In 2007, picked 4th Director -- strong fundraiser in the foundation and government worlds.

This helps facilitate our problem solving because we focus on the facts and results, and who can help, not on who gets the credit;"" used consensus decision rule; there is purposive non-partisanship designed to develop and maintain a reputation as a credible forum for resolving disputes and solving problems. The BC “bends over backwards to avoid pro-green and pro-development labels;"" shared leadership--yes, 2 co-chairs of Blackfoot Challenge, but a number of collaborative capacity builders across a broad cross-spectrum of interests, including govt, private sector, non-profits; continuity of leadership over the years--same 2 co-chairs for first 15 years (period of study here only covers 15 years); regular use of community/citizen engagement measures, including monthly meetings, watershed-wide social BBQs, and weekly meetings on major projects involving the full community.

The Challenge also employs a multi-faceted managerial strategy that envisions itself as hands-on catalyst for directing and ensuring that the work of watershed restoration gets completed in accordance with the cooperative conservation mission. The components of the strategy include: 
• the presence of the BC’s hands-on board of directors, 
• the recruitment of “focal” people, 
• the long-term perspective provided by the mission in combination with a selective partnering approach, 
• the embrace of staffing changes to fit the different stages of BC growth, 
• a core catalyst model of minimalist bureaucracy, and 
• a commitment to transparency and accountability to others. (see Weber 2012 for full development of these points)

Finally, the Challenge takes a conservative, patient approach to the projects and programs they do fund.  The basic rule is “don’t do it unless all the funding in place” (Personal Interview, 2008). Such an approach lengthens the calendar and slows progress, while simultaneously reducing the risk of incompletion and failure, this helping the BC to bolster their reputation for getting things done and getting them done successfully.

No major changes in the process observed over time.

Primary decision rule for projects is consensus. 

To track progress on water quality projects, the BC completed a $150,000 study in 2002 on a suite of physical, chemical and biological items on 12 streams. All but one of the sites showed good biological integrity, minor to no impairment, and full support of aquatic life and other beneficial uses. Nine restored streams have now been removed from the MDEQ list. This effort was followed up in 2004 with a watershed-wide Status and Trends Monitoring Project in which 30 expert volunteer field crews visited 50 previously “impaired” sites on 25 streams collecting information on stream condition and identifying restoration opportunities.

On this count there is clear evidence that collaborative efforts in the Blackfoot watershed are enjoying durable success.

--budgets at $40k to 50k during 1990s; then reaching more than $600k in 2003 and 2004, more than $2M in 2005, 2006; back down to $924k in 2007.

Programmatic Successes:

Has established and managed over 100 programs and projects. The following programs and outcomes are indicative of the kind and range of work that has earned the collaborative national recognition and a series of national performance awards.

Comprehensive Conservation Easements. Starting in 1995, the BC and one of its primary partners, the USFWS, has secured conservation easement coverage on 90,000 acres involving 65 private landowners and 75 easements. These are innovative, comprehensive approach co-developed in 1995 by the BC and USFWS that addresses all parts of a landscape as well as development pressures.

Water Conservation and Drought Management. in drought years over 70 Blackfoot River irrigators and water users share the pain of low water flows by voluntarily donating 60 cubic feet per second (cfs) to instream flows. Science shows that 60 cfs keeps water temperatures cold enough to support healthy trout populations and other key biota. Under the “Shared Sacrifice” program rights holders do not lose their rights for lack of use because is a beneficial use under state water law. To help, BC installed 15 in-ground soil moisture monitors to assist in better managing required water flows for crops/livestock. The result--every year but one since the program started in 2003, the Blackfoot River has met or exceeded the 60 cfs minimum. Also fishing bans during hot weather/low water.

Riparian Habitat, Streams, Water Quality Restoration. BC engaged 147 landowners and 500 projects in areas of highest ecological value. Restored flows to natural channels on 38 miles of streams on 41 tributaries and 62 miles of riparian areas out of a total 1,900 miles of perennial streams capable of supporting fisheries. Removed more than 460 miles of fish passage barriers, installed thirteen fish screens to prevent fish from getting into irrigation canals, and restored 2,600 acres of wetlands. Five Water Quality Restoration Plans (TMDL Plans) have been approved by EPA; off stream stock watering helps streamside plants grow, providing shade to cool water. 

The Blackfoot Community Forest Project. A comprehensive effort to restore the ecological and biological integrity of 88,000 forest acres. Purchased private land from Plum Creek Timber, deeded it over to USFS, and created a public forest jointly owned and managed by community stakeholders. 

Endangered Species and Wildlife Conservation. • Human-grizzly bear conflicts reduced by 67% since 2001 despite large increases in sightings and recolonization; 5% annual increases in elk population; reversed trumpeter swan decline; Cutthroat trout populations increased 10-fold by 2004; bull trout redds increased 5-fold in 2 streams by 2004

Noxious weeds. Engaged 380 landowners, utilizing integrated weed management practices on 45,000 acres of noxious weeds in 11 different management zones.
 
Change over time is acceleration and massive growth of problem solving capacity and program implementation.

The critical implication of this listing is that desert tortoise habit could not be disturbed.   Since the city of Las Vegas is smack-dab in the the middle of prime Desert Tortoise habitat, this listing had the potential effect of halting development in what was one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. at the time.  The U.S. Endangered Species Act does, however, provide an option for local stakeholders to come together to develop a ""habitat conservation plan"" for protection of a species while allowing habitat use.   Clark County, a county government with a very large geographic jurisdiction that includes the city of Las Vegas, took the lead on convening this habitat conservation planning process.   The process required bringing developers, ranchers, mining interests, environmental groups and a range of local, state and federal agencies together to collaboratively design a habit conservation plan.   Thus, the main goal of the planning process was to create a solution (a plan) that would protect the desert tortoise while allowing some further land development.   An important point is that much of the land in Clark County is Federal public land.
 
NOTE: In the answers above and below, I treat the ""start of the period"" as the period from the listing of the Desert Tortoise to the initiation of the habitat conservation planning process.   I treat the ""middle of the observed period"" as the early-mid period of the collaborative process when the stakeholders first forged a working process.   I treat the ""end of the period"" as the late period of the initial collaboration before it transitioned to the ""multi-species habitat conservation planning process.""
 
The process began on a very sour note because of the adversarial legal relations between the parties, but the stakeholders eventually developed a modus vivendi and crafted a plan that preserved high value tortoise habitat and allowed development on less valuable habitat (thus, it became concerned about the ""effectiveness"" of interventions to protect the tortoise; the flip-side was a concern to develop an ""efficient"" system of protection that did not prevent valuable development).   As the process developed, it required the collaborative process to ensure the legitimacy of the plan to various stakeholders, since all parties had to support the final plan (only the ranchers defected and then lost their court case).  As they worked through the process, the stakeholders also become aware of the potentially innovative nature of the planning technique and eventually they extended the process into a full-blown ""multi-species"" planning process.";3;1;Self-initiated by participants;2;3;Off;4;4;4;4;3;4;Off;Off;5;Reasonably confident;"The process started off in a very adversarial way.  Recall that the environmentalists had taken the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to court to force it to list the Desert Tortoise as an endangered species and further court cases followed to try to stop the listing (but these failed).   So the major stakeholders were very antagonistic towards one another and highly distrustful.   As noted above, the collaboration was initiated by Clark County Government under the habitat conservation planning proviso of the Endangered Species Act.   This process was not mandated, but the law gave Clark County the possibility to construct a collaborative planning process. At the same time, I would not describe this process as ""self-organized"" by stakeholders, since they evidenced little inclination to work together.  In other words, the leadership of Clark County was critical.  However, the developers did have a very strong incentive to come to the bargaining table, because otherwise further urban development would have been halted (an economically disastrous and probably unthinkable outcome from their point of view).   It is somewhat harder to understand the incentives for the environmentalists to come to the table, since the listing had basically halted all development. My best guess in this case is that they thought that a collaborative strategy would be better for preserving the Desert Tortoise in the long run.  Otherwise, it could get mired down in court with developers and other stakeholders adopting different legal and political strategms for going around the Endangered Species Act.   A very great deal was at stake for the city of Las Vegas, the state of Nevada and for the powerful developers.   There is also a difference between ""halting development"" and taking more positive steps toward protecting habitat.  There was arguably some differences in power and resources between the environmentalists and developers.  However, the more significant power asymmetry was between these stakeholders and a group of geographically dispersed and unorganized stakeholders (individual miners, off-road ethusiasts, small landowners).   Since they were individuals scattered around a wide geographical region (Clark County is huge), it would have been almost impossible for them to regularly attend planning meetings.   Clark County reduced this asymmetry by hiring a lawyer o represent these more dispersed interests.";6-okt;6-okt;6-okt;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;3;Off;3;1;3;3;Off;2;5;5;5;5;Off;5;Off;Mostly confident;"The first facilitator set out three ground rules:
 
1) No discussion about the validity of the Endangered Species Act
2) No debate over the listing of the tortoise
3) Everyone has to give up something
 
These rules are basically guidelines for ""bracketing"" the debate in order reduce tangential conflict and steer the process towards being constructive.   Other than these general ground rules, there were not many formal ground rules about iinteraction.   But there were strong norms of interaction (consensus decisionmaking, inclusiveness and transparency/openness).
 
In addition to these ground rules, the process established a steering committee, a technical advisory committee, and eventually an implementation & monitoring committee.   These committees helped to organize the work and keep the process moving forward.
 
The interaction norms were consistently applied. The designers strongly emphasized the importance of inclusiveness.  The steering committee was quite large but very representative.   There was also a public participation component and the case studies describe meetings as large as 90 people.   The key ground rule was to be transparent in decisionmaking and to give everyone a chance to speak up.   Generally, stakeholders felt like the collaborative process did a good job in giving everyone a right to speak and making stakeholders feel like it was an open and transparent process.   There was a also a norm of consensus decisionmaking.  Facilitators noted that the open, inclusive and consensual approach was a key to its success, but also note that you can never give stakeholders a chance to speak as much as they like, nor can meetings be long enough to achieve perfect unanimity.   These design norms were present from beginning to end.   The one institutional design change that is observed over time is the frequency of meetings.  One facilitator notes that the collaborative would sometimes not meet for several months (because of shifting county priorities) and then meet a couple times a week for a few weeks.   Overall, I feel like there were limited ground rules, but that the norms of inclusiveness, consensus decisionmaking, and openness were strongly and consistently adhered to.
 
The downside of inclusiveness, consensus decisionmaking and openness was a lot of long, exhausting meetings.";Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;3;5;5;Off;5;5;5;Off;5;5;5;Off;3;Off;3;3;Mostly confident;"As noted above, Clark County took the lead in convening the process.  The process would not have gotten off the ground without the convening role of the County. However, for the running of the meetings, the County hired a faciliator who did a excellent job of mediating conflicts (mediator) and maintaining the integrity of the collaborative process (steward).  Skilled facilitation (especially mediation) was considered to be a key ingredient of the success of this collaboration.   One point made in the Aengst case document is that the skilled facilitation was responsible for keeping people at the table and one of the most remarkable aspects of this case was the high degree of stability of those who participated over a nine year planning period.
 
Although a skilled facilitator led the meetings, the creation of a steering committee implies a collective leadership.  The steering committee was composed of public organizations and private associations representing different interests.
 
I have a harder time judging the ""catalyst"" role.   Certainly, the process developed in a creative and innovative fashion.   However, it is difficult to say from the case record whether the facilitator was critical for steering this creativity and innovation.   I would suspect the answer is yes, but the case doesn't provide much guidance on this point.
 
I see mostly consistency in leadership over time and don't see any major leadership shifts.   Perhaps it is worth emphasizing that there was a bifurcation in leadership roles.   The County Government was the lead actor and served as the convenor.  However, it also hired a professional facilitator to conduct the meetings.  This was probably a good idea, because the County was also a stakeholder in the process.

Early meetings had to have ""gun checks"" (this is the Wild Wild West!) and there was a sense of alienation.
 
Joint fact-finding missions were important early in the process.  Participants took field trips together to look at different tortoise habitats and this personalized the negotiation.   
 
The communication process was ""face-to-face"" and very intense at times.
 
Shared knowledge formation was a critical part of the process.   A lot of the different agencies have different kinds of technical expertise and the capacity to conduct scientific studies. The importance of knowledge is indicated by the fact that there was a ""technical advisory committee (TAC).""   The overall process was led by a steering committee, but there was also the TAC and eventually an implementation and monitoring committee.   At times, there was also public participation in meetings.   So this was not a strongly centralized process, but it did have some elements of central direction.
 
The case materials make it pretty clear that over time and through face-to-face communication and personal interaction, people developed respect for each other (despite ongoing conflict) and a sense of joint ownership over the process.   It is also clear that the process gradually built trust that was essential for fruitful compromise.";2;3;5;Off;2;3;5;Off;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;3;4;2;2;3;3;1;2;2;1;2;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Not very confident;"I felt like this was hardest set of questions to answer given what I know about the case.   The Clark County Board of Commissioners (elected) provided critical early leadership in convening the collaboration and provided important financial support.   However, the collaboration itself included agencies and non-profit groups.  Individuals participated to some degree, but I would say this was a process more driven by organized stakeholders than by independent citizens.   However, Clark County did hire a lawyer to represent the more dispersed and unorganized (rural) citizens.   The collaboration did take seriously the need to gain external input from citizens, but the core of the negotiating was done by 25-30 representatives of different organized interests.
 
The overarching goal was to find a workable solution to the tradeoff between environmental protection and economic development.   The law itself provided some of the framework and defined some aspects of the habitat planning process.   However, I would say that the goals got specified over time in an emergent fashion.   Ultimately, the process produced a detailed habitat plan.
 
The relationship to the Clark County Board of Commissioners continued throughout the collaboration because the County provided funding.   The collaborative therefore periodically explained itself to the commissioners in the context of making requests for funding.
 
Courts had indirect influence over the proceedings in the sense that legal dispute was the ""sword of damocles""--participants saw the collaborative process as preferable to going back to court.
 
Many of the agencies involved had regulatory functions and I am sure that local field office personnel had to explain the collaborative decisionmaking to higher level agency officials.  However, the case materials focus more on what is happening in the collaborative process than what is happening outside of it.    In addition, the process took place within the framework of Endangered Species regulation.   However, the purpose  of the habitat planning process is to allow groups to come up with their own plans, so this was not a case of direct regulatory control.  
 
Since much of the issue ended up focusing on preservation of tortoise habitat on public lands, and in particular, Bureau of Land Management land, the whole process was subject to the legal and regulatory frameworks of federal resource agencies.
 
I don't see much evidence of changing dynamics as the collaboration progressed.   As noted earlier, the high degree of stability of participation by stakeholders (including state and federal agencies with regulatory functions) was one of the prominent features of the collaboration.

By 1992, 400,000 acres had already been protected and the plan ultimately protected 800,000 to 1 million acres (Beatley; Hoben).
 
Millions of dollars in ""mitigation fees"" were also collected to support this habitat conservation ($550/acre was charged to developers and this money was then used to purchase prime tortoise habit and to support other preservation activities).
 
Much useful science about the desert tortoise was produced (there was a high degree of scientific uncertainty at the outset; research filled in some of the holes, though certainty was of course never--and probably could never--be achieved).
 
Other mitigation strategies were developed beyond land preservation.
 
Perhaps the most remarkable outcome of this collaborative planning process is that it transitioned into a ""multi-species"" planning process.    Basically, the success of the Desert Tortoise process convinced the stakeholders that they could work together in this fashion to produce ""win-win"" outcomes.    Thus, the process continued several more years after the Desert Tortoise plan was finished.
 
An implementation & monitoring committee was also created to follow through on the implementation of the plan and monitor the results.
 
The basic pattern I see is that the stakeholders began the process incapable of working together effectively.   Through the collaborative process, they began to develop effective working relationship and momentum built for a more ambitious strategy over time (from a plan for a single species to a multi-species plan).    Thus, I often found myself coding a ""1"" in the initial period, a ""3"" in the middle period, and a ""5"" in the final period in order to convey the momentum that developed over time.

The response to this earthquake really set the stage for NGOs involvement in disaster management in Turkey. The state authorities also realize that they can't employ and keep enough cadres of professional SAR staff who sit and wait for an earthquake. Like an NGO representative said, ""if it is normal day, they have 100 SAR staff, it is a disaster, they have 100 SAR staff. For us, if it is a normal day, we are 1, if it is a disaster, we are 5000"".

The stated ambition on the regional state authority level is to improve collaboration by increasing trust though joint exercises and education. The stated ambition on behalf of the NGOs is to be able to save more lives, which they (mostly) have a better chance to do if collaborating with the state as it provides them with access to more resources and finances and also may speed up their operations (for example when the state flew them to the disaster area). 
 
(3) After the 1999 earthquake, the Turkish disaster management system was reformed. A new agency (AFAD) charged with responsibility for all matters pertaining to disasters was created in 2009. Since the creation of AFAD there has been an increased focus on working with various NGOs, among others SAR NGOs. The NGOs interviewed noticed a difference in outreach and interest on behalf of the state since the creation of AFAD, since then, steps toward collaboration have been more tangible. AFAD for example arranges joint workshops, trainings and meetings and there has also been collaboration in SAR activities in the big cities during non-disaster times. AFAD has also strived to professionalize their SAR staff and aspire to have their regional SAR teams INSARAG-certified (international UN-standard) and some of the teams have also reached this goal. 
 
The increased interactions between AFAD and the SAR NGOs has resulted in mutual trust and smooth working relationships and role assignment is clear. This was also seen in the case of Van and Ercis. The NGOs I interviewed had no problems to be coordinated by AFAD while they also have a highly professional organization internally which means that they also can manage and coordinate their resources on their own if needed. During the Van and Ercis earthquakes the AFAD coordinated SAR NGOs from several cities and let them on the state's chartered planes to the area struck. On site, the SAR collaboration with AFAD and SAR NGOs was well-functioning according to many of those involved, both those directly in the collaboration, but also according to actors working in other parts of the disaster response operations.

Yet implicitly, and since AFAD is a state agency, they ""call the shots"" and decide which NGOs or university's that get invited to workshops and trainings (some university's have their own SAR teams). My impression was that AFAD prefers to collaborate with the largest and most experienced SAR NGOs, which perhaps is not surprising. 
 
(3) Don't know
 
(4) Given that there was a disaster situation in 2011, two years after the creation of AFAD, the collaborative forum naturally changed from conference halls or workshop rooms to crisis coordination centers during those weeks that the response operations went on. After the earthquakes, the regularity of and invitations to various AFAD meetings and consultations decreased. This was not only noted by SAR NGOs but also others like disaster management experts and advisors that previously used to attend meetings at AFAD too.

I got the impression that this leadership was collegial and not bureaucratic or hierarchical. The bureaucrats and policy makers at AFAD in Ankara however seemed to have another attitude, where they want to direct and set standards and various policies, which also in their job.
 
(2) Some SAR NGO actors are impressed with the initiatives taken by AFAD early on and appreciate that they really reach out to SAR NGOs, which very rarely happened before when the Directorate of Civil Defense were in charge of SAR. (This is a general tendency, AFAD strategy documents now list NGOs as strategic solution partners next to giants like the Ministry of Defense.) During the earthquakes, some NGOs had troubles getting access and accreditation and felt directed and like they could only work in certain areas (politically motivated) but the SAR NGOs that had built trusting relationships with AFAD had no such problems. SAR NGOs also easily accepted working under the authority of AFAD, which was not always the case with other NGOs. 
 
Some of the more experienced SAR NGOs also know how to operate so as not to ""upset"" AFAD leadership. ""You have to be very careful as an NGO to not step on them, or you know, to try to take the leadership in these occasions"". The situation described was a collaborative search mission with AFAD, where the actors from the SAR NGO was more experienced than the AFAD staff present. But the SAR NGOs generally seem to know how to navigate to make to collaborative process run smoothly while also managing to rescue or assist individuals. One SAR NGO described how, after the initial SAR operations were over, they switched to delivering aid instead. In this task they were formally under the provincial governor's command. But in this case, this NGO actively avoided collaboration with the provincial governorate's crisis coordination center to be able to deliver aid more effectively. The SAR NGO team leader said that ""sometimes it is better to not push aside the government, but if there is an immediate need, I don't want to wait for five or six days for everything to get settled"". 
 
(3) Following the earthquake, the Ministry of Interior released a report (of an evaluative character) that among other things stated that SAR capacity had improved immensely since the earthquakes in 1999. It however also stated that AFAD's SAR teams outperformed  the NGOs' SAR teams. When asking interviewees about this many were in agreement that this was not really true but that the state ""had to"" write like that. Such statements combined with AFAD bureaucrats' obsession with standards and paperwork have dampened the spirits with some SAR NGOs.

(1) Outputs of the collaboration include increased interaction between SAR teams from the public and private non-profit sector, at national and regional levels. Increased interaction lead to trust and good relations. These good relations, all agreed, was crucial for how well the SAR operations went during the earthquakes. The collaboration also included joint trainings and education. By these repeated interactions, role division also became clear. 
 
(2) The immediate, and most apparent outcome was successful SAR-operations following the earthquakes. By international standards, the percent of those rescued was higher than in other comparable earthquakes. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This includes directors or deputy directors from the ministries of Justice, Defense, Social Affairs, Health, and Finance, plus directors of the intelligences agencies, police, crown prosecution, customs, national guard, and other organizations. The Committee is chaired by the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security, a civil servant with his own relatively small agency to support him.
 
The Committee is tasked with supporting the minister of Justice in formulating and implementing policies to counter violent extremism and terrorism. The Committee is specifically responsible for ensuring cohesion between the policies of the different parts of government, and between international, national, and local initiatives. The Dutch counterterrorism community strives for a Comprehensive Approach, combining preventive, repressive, security, and social cohesion measures to fight terrorism.
 
For the period of 2011 to 2015, the Committee was guided by a minister-approved National Counterterrorism Strategy, which aimed to (a) prevent attacks, (b) limit the impact of any attacks that do occur, and (c) reduce the societal fear for attacks. This explicit strategy was formulated in 2011 on the basis of a previous evaluation of the counterterrorism field between 2001 and 2010, which concluded the agencies lacked a cohesive framework. This extensive strategy contained details and priorities for fulfilling the overall aims of the Dutch counterterrorism policy. Priorities included improving information sharing, increasing technological government capabilities, and improving international collaborations in the fight against chemical and biological weapons. 
 
The Netherlands had seen a political assassination by a left-wing extremist in 2002 and attacks by a cell of Al-Qaeda in 2004. Since 2009, the official threat level had remained at `minimal.' The strategy of 2011 was therefore written in a period of relative calm. However, the societal context and threat level changed dramatically between 2011 and 2015. The rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria drew radicalized Muslims from the Netherlands and raised the specter of new attacks. In 2013, the Dutch intelligence agencies signaled that the Islamic terrorist threat had morphed from international, vertically organized networks  -such as al-Qaeda- into locally emerging and horizontally organized `swarms' of individual threats. By the end of 2017 over 270 Dutch nationals had joined ISIS. Attacks across Western Europe from 2012 onwards, although never in the Netherlands, showed that this threat was very concrete.
 
The evolving threat put pressure on the responsible ministries and agencies. In 2014, the committee had to quickly formulate an Action Plan to present to parliament, including preventive, repressive, security, and social cohesion measures. The minister of Justice, in collaboration with the minister of Social Affairs, took public responsibility for the implementation of this action plan. The Committee also face the rise of societal tensions around the arrival of refugees from Syria, raising the threat of right wing extremist violence or left wing extremist pro-refugee threats.";3;3;Externally directed by law or authority;2;2;Off;2;3;3;4;2;3;Off;Off;5;Mostly confident;"The Committee was formed in response to the wave of attacks at the beginning of the 21st century. The attacks of 9/11 but especially Madrid prompted many European countries to create explicit counterterrorist legislation and coordinative bodies. Although the Committee is formally rooted in a 2004 ministerial decree, most of these organizations have longstanding relationships with each other across multiple domains. They work together on drugs trafficking, emergency management, or immigration control. The opinions of each other have therefore been formed by many different interactions.
 
There were some significant divisions between these parties. A first distinction can be made between the security versus the social development focused partners. The police, intelligence agencies, and Home Office tended to focus on the security causes and implications for violent extremism. The ministry for Social Affairs, Education, and Health looked to more personal or social drivers, and were also concerned with the wider impact of terrorist attacks on societal tensions and cohesion.
 
Moreover, there was an imbalance in the weight and attention given to specific issues. Preventive interventions, such as adequate schooling and early social support for potentially radicalizing individuals were signaled as important in the 2011 strategy, but did not to get the same weight as more repressive measures targeting identified terrorists or protecting potential targets. These imbalances tended to give the police and other security services the upper hand in the committee, while the socially oriented partners, such as the Ministry of Social Affairs and Education stopped participating in the meetings in the first years after 2011.
 
With the launch of the 2011 strategy, the security-oriented partners mainly focused on their joint activities in the security domain, for example, sharing more information and countering chemical threats. The overall strength of the committee was initially undermined by deep budget cuts across all agencies following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The ministry of Social Affairs lost its Social Polarization Unit, the intelligence agency had to let go of a large number of experts, and the National Police was preoccupied with a large internal reorganization. 
 
With the emergence of a clear threat from 2013 onwards, the committee gained in importance and cohesion. The different agencies received extra funding to deal with the extra work, the ministries of Social Affairs, Education, and Health became active members again, and the partners started working more closely on their collective interventions. The Action Plan of 2014 was an explicit mix of both social and security focused measures, combining preventive and repressive interventions. 
 
Based on specific projects and interventions targeting local ISIS recruiters or extremist cells, the security and social partners discovered that their interventions had to be combined to be effective. For example, the police force may detain a suspected ISIS recruiter, but the social services need to then immediately reach out the pupils of the recruiter, offering them jobs and housing to prevent them from further radicalizing.

The Committee is also instructed to act in accordance with the relevant laws on policing, information sharing, and state secrets. Further procedures are purposefully not made public given the sensitive nature of the Committee work.
 
In line with the relatively informal administrative culture of the Netherlands, which often favors collaboration and committee rule over strict separations and hierarchy, the Committee itself did not develop extensive protocols or procedures. The National Coordinator acted as chair and mediator, rather than chief or monitor (see Leadership block). The meetings were structured in accordance with the business at hand and partners were invited to join the committee when deemed useful.
 
The wider rules structuring the hierarchies and relationships between the agencies was in some cases very extensive. For example, the police was placed under the command of both the minister of Justice and the Crown Prosecution, just as Customs was ultimately answerable to the minister of Finance. The intelligence agencies were not allowed to indiscriminately share sensitive data with the prosecution, as information gathered through intelligence instruments may not be easily admissible in court.
 
In a pragmatic turn, especially in times of pressure, these rules were often tested and adjusted where possible. The partners created a separate unit where representatives of different organizations could quickly share data on individuals deemed to be a risk (a so-called Counterterrorism Infobox). If these professionals thought it necessary, they could make a formal request for handing over data formally from one organization to the other.
 
During the drafting of the 2014 Action Plan, some cracks did appear in these inclusive and transparent rules. The minister of Justice promised parliament the quick delivery of a plan to counter so-call `Jihadism', sending the national coordinator in quick dash for collecting different proposals. Looking back on those frantic days, several actors felt that they were not sufficiently involved, especially civil servants representing the constitutional checks on investigative powers or partners representing the social cohesion perspective.";Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;4;3;4;Off;2;3;4;Off;2;3;4;Off;2;Off;3;4;Mostly confident;"The Netherlands opted specifically for a National Coordinator for Counterterrorism in 2004, rather than appointing an overall director or `czar' for Homeland Security. The idea was that too many different agencies had to be involved in a counterterrorism strategy than could reasonably be amalgamated, and that the Dutch administrative culture was not suited to a single director overruling other departments.
 
In comparison to much older institutions such as the police or Crown Prosecution, the Coordinator was a relatively new player. Most partners signaled their respect in interviews for the dedication and expertise of the Coordinator. The Coordinator himself and his staff were seen as committed to the shared outcomes of all the different partners and capable of quickly connecting different policy domains.
 
The Coordinator was particularly active in connecting individual interventions and providing backup capacity. The Action Plan was used by the Coordinator to combine all the separate powers and activities of different agencies into one unified response. During this first crisis time, the Coordinator staff would also provide knowledge and manpower to the police, local government, social welfare agencies which lacked either knowledge about violent extremism or capacity to act. Some criticism from the police, prosecution, and intelligence agencies was then be that the Coordinator was taking over their role, although all parties admitted such minor turf wars are to be expected in collaborations.
 
The Coordinator did face more serious criticism from the partners in that he himself and his agency were too close to the minister, acting as an political enforcer rather than a neutral broker. Especially as the pressure rose after 2013, the Coordinator took responsibility for making sure that agreed upon measures were quickly implemented and were reported to parliament. The executive agencies felt that the politicians and Coordinator were focusing too much on the quantitative results, while most of the gains would be of a more qualitative nature.

The main divisions, such as between the security and social cohesion actors, did not manifest themselves  through open conflict, but indirect attempts to mend the fences through bilateral conversations.
 
The parties had to work together intensively to make solutions happen. This was true before the rise of ISIS, where the agencies has work together to align their information systems and strategic priorities, and even more so after the threat became apparent in 2013, when parties had to closely operate in targeting specific threats.
 
The strategy of 2011 provided a formalized vision of the desired collective outcomes. This vision was mainly written the National Coordinator staff, acting act as mediator and broker between the different agencies. The shard vision was built through a range of bilateral and sometimes collective meetings about the strategy and specific operational priorities.
 
Between 2011 and 2013, most of the focus was on adjusting the threat level and executing the agreed plan, with no real changes in the outlook of partners. In 2014, the domestic intelligence agency published a memo detailing the shift from international terrorist networks to horizontally organized `swarms'. This new vision provided a new frame to understand the evolving threat and was quickly adopted by the different partners.
 
The Action Plan of 2014 which was drafted in response to the changing circumstances came about rushed circumstances (see other sections). The Coordinator would organize collective sessions for all partners that could be available at short notice. The proposed actions were often recycled plans already desired by specific partners, such as new passport control measures and extra data gathering capabilities. This process caused considerable friction between the parties, especially between the constitutional camp and the security agencies. 
 
Over time partners came to appreciate the value and added benefits of bringing different perspectives to the table. The police, for example, became a strong advocate for more investment in social service in order to provide better services for individuals turned away from radicalization and towards social integration. Partners so started to purposefully integrate different perspectives in their policy proposals and actions plans to utilize their collective strength and create broad appeal, although differences would still flare up regularly
 ";4;5;4;Off;4;5;4;Off;3;5;5;Off;2;4;4;2;2;2;Off;Off;2;4;4;Off;2;4;4;Off;2;2;4;4;2;2;2;2;2;2;2;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"The formulation of the first collective counterterrorist strategy in 2011 provided clear goals and more explicit accountability mechanisms. The different partners monitored each other's contributions to the execution of the strategy by collectively reviewing their progress in the Committee meetings. They were externally governed by laws on intelligence work and supervised by a select parliamentary committee on intelligence. When the strategy was published in 2011, the minister also promised parliament a public evaluation in 2015. This evaluation was duly executed by independent academic researchers (see link provided).
 
The Action Plan of 2014 contained even more explicit actions and measures, with the ministers reporting progress to parliament every three months. A problem was that measures could be formally implemented, i.e. a change in the law on dual nationality of terror suspects, but the question was still how often the measure was used in practice and what the effects of the intervention were. Partners felt that a true measure of progress would rely on more qualitative insights in the ability of the partners to collaboratively counter different types of threats.
 
Several oversights agencies were also involved in holding the collective agencies to account. Another evaluation commission reviewed the information sharing between the agencies about specific individuals (the aforementioned Counterterrorism InfoBox). The Court of Auditors published a review of the effect of the previous budget cuts on the intelligence agencies. The Inspectorate of Security reviewed the implementation of the different anti-radicalization policies at the local level.
 
The committee itself did not have an extensive public profile, most of the advocacy groups and citizens committees would therefore direct their messages at the relevant politicians.. The civil servants at some of the organizations, especially the ministries, would work directly with societal groups to prepare proposals or build support. However, due to subsidy cuts by previous government, most of the collective representing Muslim minorities, a group strongly affected by the policies, had become defunct by 2013. The rising investment in executive agencies was however accompanied with new subsidies for such societal groups in 2014.

An absence of terrorist attacks is not a sign success; the policy efforts may have indeed prevented attacks, but a country might have also gotten lucky. Any evaluation of the impact of this network, especially an abstract look at outcomes, needs to be very cautious and modest. We can observe that there were no formally recognized terrorist attacked in the years 2011 to 2015. However, more than 20 mosques were attacked with fire bombs in this period, but these were not treated as terrorist incidents by the police. Also, etween 2012 and 2016 over 270 Dutch nationals joined ISIS. 
 
The collective agencies lost collective strength and capacity in the first years after 2011. The budget cuts and reorganizations severely affected the intelligence agencies and the police, where the network also lost the engagement of the socially oriented partners. When ISIS started recruiting people, the agencies and media reported several failed attempts to identify radicalizing individuals. In later years, the agencies were more confident they had the knowledge, resources, and contacts to identify potentially radicalizing individuals.
 
The innovative capacity of the Committee did therefore not lie in developing new services, but finding simple yet effective ways to join their collective problem solving capacity. In the beginning, the Committee achieved concrete innovative results in restructuring several of their processes, such as streamlining information sharing, improving threat analysis, and limiting biological and chemical threats. After 2014, the partners responded to the threat in 2014 with a series of fairly innovative local deradicalization programs, where different cities would receive customized support in targeting specific groups in their locality. The lessons from the 2011-2015 period also led to a new approach to strategy formulation, emphasizing collaboration and flexibility in the national strategy drafted for 2016-2020.
 
The legitimacy of the Committee changed over the years. The Committee only had support from a narrow group of security agencies, and did also not seek engagement or support from other partners. The first responses to the new ISIS threat were criticized for being too security focused, ignoring the social aspect of radicalization, and eroded support from minority groups and human rights organizations for the initial government response. The subsequent reconnection with the more socially focused partners, allowed the Committee to tweak its messaging, champion investment in the causes of radicalization, and so broaden the support for the overall approach of counterterrorism.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Netherlands and the consideration being given to establishing an addiction clinic mobilized a
small group of active inhabitants who were willing to take over the centre. Since its start in April
2012, when ''Het Klokhuis'' was legally established, about 300–400 inhabitants visit the centre
each day and they are served by 40–50 volunteers. The building is rented from a third party to
which the municipality has outsourced the exploitation of their buildings. Commercial activities
such as renting spaces to other parties (such as for childcare) financially compensate for the
social activities that are carried out to foster social cohesion. Furthermore, ‘Het Klokhuis’
provides internships in cooperation with the UWV (the Dutch unemployment agency), Wi-Fi
hotspots, a small library, sports and hobby lessons, buddy projects for migrants and/or
unemployed people and a low-threshold location to facilitate meetings, for instance with the
police. The stated ambition of ''Het Klokhuis'' is that commercial activities cover the costs of the
more social activities of the center. However, they have not yet succeeded in this ambition as
they are still financially dependent from the Amersfoort municipality with whom they closely
collaborate. During the observed period, the struggle for money to keep the community center
open and running is a key one. For this reason they have regular meetings with public officials
and politicians from the municipality. The interactions between initiators and the municipality was
certainly at the beginning of the process strongly structured with a clear set of time, legal and
financial guidelines that are formulated by the municipality and then ‘forced upon’ the initiators.
During the process the municipality became somewhat more flexible. The ability and willingness
to change the guidelines (in terms of exchanging knowledge and learning) can be explained by
the fact that a community manager was able to link people and ideas resulting in improved trust
between the initiators and the municipality parties, protected by the aldermen. Next to a strong
hierarchical involvement of the municipality through the definition and enforcement of key
parameters, rules-of-play and all kinds of requirements to be fulfilled, we see supportive actions
through providing initiators with contacts, expert knowledge, useful information and the building
lease. ";2;1;Self-initiated by participants;1;2;Off;4;4;2;4;5;4;Off;Off;4;Highly confident;"(A) In Amersfoort, the initiators and the community manager shared a history of community
activities. The initiators knew each other (establishing social capital), and had experience with
how local politics worked in terms of political/institutional capital, which helped set the wheels in
motion. However, scepticism continued: ‘We really had to build the level of trust with the
municipality itself’ (interviewed initiators). The recurring interactions between initiators and key
municipal people – civil servants and the responsible alderman – gradually helped the initiators
feel positive about their plans and helped create a shared vision. The openness and frequency of
these meetings led to the involved citizens feeling recognized. The alderman involved stated:
‘Contacts were frequent and also cordial. When the initiators asked me for time and attention,
they always got it’. Eventually, the Board of Aldermen approved the citizens taking over the
centre. Furthermore, the initial scepticism stimulated the initiators to stick together and feel
motivated: ‘Our confidence has grown rather than declined as the result of the critical attitude of
the municipality’ (interviewed initiators). (B) The top-down closure of the former community centre
by the Amersfoort municipality and the consideration being given to establishing an addiction
clinic mobilized a small group of active inhabitants who were willing to take over the centre. This
was an important trigger: ‘We took a lot of actions and attended all the public hearing sessions in
order to prevent an addiction care centre being located in the previous centre’ (interviewed
initiators). The initiators organized a lobby to convince local politicians to consider alternatives.
‘We forced the alderman to talk to us about us taking over the centre. If necessary, we would
even have occupied the building’ (interviewed initiators). The increased political pressure
convinced the town council to adopt a resolution that forced the alderman responsible to
organize a public tendering proce- dure for the centre. There was a single disruptive triggering
event that fuelled the self-organization process, which can be viewed as a NIMBY-like response
(not in my back yard) that changed the meaning that the inhabitants gave to the location. It
emphasized their community belonging. From the side of the municipality there was no plan in
the beginning. There was a constant threat that the municipality, framed by the initiators and
citizens as ‘the opposition party’, would intervene in a top-down way and sell the building on the
open market if the citizen group’s plan was not sufficiently strong or if they did not meet the
requirements. This threat kept the initiators on their toes by creating a sense of urgency and also
increased support from other inhabitants that convinced the initiators to keep going: ‘It was going
to happen either way, good or bad’. (C) From the beginning of the process on, there certainly
was a sense of interdependency. The initiators needed the real estate and financial resources of
the municiplity. The municipality on the other hand needed the local community resources of the
initiators to set up (and/or continue) innovative and effective services. (D) Over the time, the
interdependency relationship continued to exist. As policies and political context change, it
remains a struggle for the initiators to safeguard structural support from the municipality. The
Amersfoort municipality would like to see that ''Het Klokhuis'' will become more financially
independent.";6-okt;6-okt;6-okt;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;3;Off;3;4;4;4;Off;4;2;4;2;4;Off;2;Off;Mostly confident;"(A) Especially at the beginning of the process, the municipality set out the ground rules for the
collaboration. The initiators were allowed to produce their own welfare services and take over the
building that was public property, but within the framework created by government. For instance,
there had to be a strict seperation of functions between the community and the board of the
association and their business case had to be reviewed by a third party. The initiators were forced
to develop a (financial) plan, and this constrained their space to manoeuvre. Again, the involvement
of an alderman and the community manager helped the civil servants become more willing to
change their roles and to adapt existing rules. ‘The conditions that restricted us were loosened by
the municipality so that we could act in a more business-like manner’ (interviewed initiators). (B)
The collaborative forums are inclusive - all parties are allowed to participate - the access is for
example not restricted by rules (C) To the collaborative partners is not entirely clear how the
municipality internally comes to its decisions. In this respect, the collaborative forum is not really
open and inclusive in all stages of the collaboration. The municipality is the most powerful actor in
the collaboration process due to its unique resourcs. (D) No significant changes.

The
process would not have gotten off the ground without the boundary spanning leadership of public
officials and politicians. The community manager and the alderman responsible conducted
significant boundary-spanning activities, thereby fostering trust. The alderman ensured political
support and protected the initiative, making it easier for the community manager to overcome
resistance within the municipality. One initiator observed: ‘The role of the community manager was
a tough one since she experienced a lot of resistance’. The alderman commented: ‘I think my close
involvement was one of the key factors for success’. This was important because ‘the municipality
is a seven-headed monster, and some heads trust the initiators but other heads do not’ (interviewed
civil servant). The ability and willingness to change the guidelines (in terms of exchanging
knowledge and learning) can be explained by the fact that the community manager was able to link
people and ideas resulting in improved trust between the initiators and the municipality parties,
protected by the aldermen. On the side of the community enterprise ''Het Klokhuis'' there was also
one leading initiator. She had a more transformational leadership style by motivating the other
volunteers to keep going and keep pushing the municipality in the direction she wanted them to go.
I see no changes in leadership over time or any major leadership shifts. Although the politicians
changed (because of re-elections), they remained committed and facilitating.";5;5;5;Off;5;5;5;Off;2;4;2;Off;4;3;3;Off;4;3;Off;Off;Off;4;4;4;4;Off;Yes;4;Off;Off;4;Off;Mostly confident;"The closing of the community centre and the NIMBY reaction to a threatened addiction clinic
acted as a disruptive event that mobilized citizens to take over the community centre. The plan
that was developed by the local community can be regarded as a process of mobilization against
the municipality that had provoked them. This emerging tension can explain why the Amersfoort
municipality chose to create a fear-based shadow of hierarchy. While accepting this alternative
solution, the municipality wanted to control the centre’s development. Again over time, these
tensions were eased by boundary-spanning activities that generated trust. The fear-based
collaboration process provided focus and structured the interactions between the initiators and
the municipality through the imposition of various guidelines and requirements. A more
benevolent interaction also became visible once the initial distrust and scepticism were replaced
by a more positive attitude. The communication process between municipality and community
enterprise (the inner circle of the collaboration process) mostly is on a face-to-face and a weekly
basis with public officials, and on a monthly basis with politicians. The recurring interactions
between initiators and key municipal people – civil servants and the responsible alderman –
gradually helped the initiators feel positive about their plans and helped create a shared vision.
The openness and frequency of these meetings led to the involved citizens feeling recognized.
Halfway the process, however, a more distrustful relationship emerged because of problems with
the renewed financing of the community enerprise by the municipality. Involved parties describe
the process as laborious and time-consuming, and the attitude of the initiators of the community
enterprise as rather aggressive as they seek a lot of political attention. It is effective though.

As the
ownership of the exploitation of ''Het Klokhuis'' is firmly rooted in the hands of the initiators of the
community enterprise, the question is whether their goals are truly ''joined'' with the municipality.
There are of course specific sub-goals formulated (that are attached to the subsidy the
community enterprise received) that are actively monitored and operationalized. These goals are
determined by politicians and public officials, but the initiators of the community enterprise do
have a say. I don't see much evidence of changed dynamics, as noted earlier - the battle for
public money and efficiency is a recurring one.

organization. ‘Het Klokhuis’ is generally seen as a success story. Since its start in April 2012,
when it was legally established, about 300–400 inhabitants visit the centre each day and they are
served by 40–50 volunteers. In the beginning phase there were 20.000 visitors on a yearly basis,
while in 2018 the counted number of visitors rose to 55.000 (not unique but total). A wide variety
of welfare services are provided: from psychriatic self-care groups to buddy projects for migrants.
To my knowledge, there are no negative unintended consequences. Perhaps the most
remarkable outcome is that an innovative and novel community center is exploited by volunteers
from the local community. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the Dutch government to solving problems in deprived neighborhoods. Community networks
were strengthned and specific boundary spanning public officials were hired by the Amsterdam
municipality to help build new relationships between citizens and the municipality. One of the key
policy priorities was to establish an ''experimentation zone'' in which community enterprises such
as The Meevaart collaborate with the municipality under supportive conditions. The intention is
that De Meevaart offers a place for all kinds of local groups and initiatives so that they can meet
and develop activities both in and beyond De Meevaart. By creating this overarching meeting
place, the initiators aim to improve the social cohesion in the neighbourhood (such as by

renovating the community centre in 2010, the municipality wanted to put the building on the
property market. This plan triggered the inhabitants to approach the municipality with a plan to
take over the building as they were looking for a location for their activities. Furthermore, the
establishment of an experimentation zone that allowed communities to experiment with new
activities beyond existing legal and financial practices made possible by the Dutch Ministry of the
Interior also boosted its development. In sum, the establishment of the enterprise was embedded
in an environment in which citizen participation, and thus collaboration with the municipality, had
flourished for many years. The initiators and civil servants had known each other for years and
they valued each other’s work. There are no significant changes over time in the period

Ministry of the Interior actively explored the redrafting of rules and regulations that hindered
change, such as allowing volunteers to receive compensation: ‘The upcoming period will be used
to transform and apply rules that ease the start of community enterprises’ . The energetic and free
flow of ideas, knowledge and experiences led to numerous ideas and partnerships on how to
develop the enterprise, which was also a goal of the municipality: ‘We want to make things possible
and build on partnerships: we try to connect many parties in order to facilitate mutual
learning’(interviewed civil servant). The decision making process was very transparenti, inclusive
and open. As a result, the initiators and neighbourhood inhabitants were still working on
establishing a shared vision in order to elaborate the centre’s mission. This was proving hard to

things attractive by inspiring stories and offering subsidies’ (interviewed civil servant). Furthermore,
platforms were organized to share the experiences of similar initiatives. Municipal boundary
spanners were able to bring people together in the enterprise. The programme manager and one of
her policy officers on the central municipality level were actively linking people, ideas and
resources. This helped overcome and avoid deadlocks. A civil servant said: ‘When I know that a
district is struggling with a topic, I make sure that they contact a district that is very developed in
that area so that they can help each other’. Furthermore, the municipality organized meetings and
facilitated contacts with relevant parties to find alternative funding. In addition, the responsible
aldermen frequently met with the initiators. By showing their support, they made the involved
people feel recognized. The municipality tried to support and facilitate the process by providing all
kinds of resources rather than influencing directly by imposing norms and guidelines. The kind of
leadership can therefore best be described as supportive, inspirational and connecting: a ‘soft’
approach was visible, one that made use of supportive actions (providing resources), storytelling
and helpful changes to the rules of the game (setting up the experimentation zone).There were no
changes in leadership dynamics observed over time.

Vietnam constitutes a special case not only because it provides an example collaborative governance in a developing country but also more importantly due to its distinct highly centralized political system. The central government is the highest organ of the governance system, and it is controlled by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The CPV is the only legal party in Vietnam and its Central Committee is the top decision-making body. The local governance system in Vietnam is based on a three-tier system: the provincial level, the district level and the commune (township) level. Local-level governments in Vietnam have a popularly elected council, the People’s Council, as well as an executive organ, the People’s Committee. The People’s Council is the local organ of state power: it is accountable not only to the local citizens, but also to the superior state organs. The People’s Committee, on the other hand, is the local organ of the state administration and is responsible for implementing the decisions made at the higher level. In addition to the councils and committees, the local governments will also often have specialized agencies under the direct control of central line ministries. The key agency of relevance for flood relief is the Central Committee for Flood and Storm control.
The governance collaboration between the central government and local communes/association was meant to reduce the adverse impact of flooding for rural vulnerable households. Flooding is the dominant natural hazard stress factor for vulnerable households in our research sites where 80% of the households categorised themselves as being highly vulnerable to floods. Relative to other stress factors (such as illness, access to credit and access to land), flooding disasters were singled out in our survey as having the most serious impact on people’s livelihoods. People’s susceptibility to flooding was less caused by floods as such (most households are dependent on limited flooding for irrigation of their crops) but by flooding variability and severity. Households complained that traditional coping strategies, such as elevated in-house storage facilities and conduits to protect against saturation, were no longer sufficient protection against floods that they considered to be more severe, faster (flash floods) and out of sync with the usual weather patterns (possibly because of climate change combined with the construction of hydropower plants and extensive deforestation). Thus, many households were dependent on state relief to cope with floods. One of the few consistent findings in the disaster literature is the fact that the link between the vulnerable households and local governance is vital in a disaster situation. In situations where all community members face similar kinds of covariate risks, the local government institutions can play an important role as a protector of the last resort. Concretely, the emergency relief consisted mostly of rice, noodles, drinking water and a little cash.
We did not observe any major changes to either issues or ambitions in the research period, but it should be stressed that our research did not contain a substantial temporal component. While our anticipation was that an increased focus on participatory projects might impact the nature of collaborative governance, it was noticeable how little impact they, in fact, had on the overarching centralized governance structure and processes. 
";5;Off;Externally directed by law or authority;1;1;Off;4;4;1;4;5;5;Off;Off;5;Mostly confident;"In terms of institutional responses to natural disasters, the Central Committee for Flood and Storm control has been operational since 1955. The Ordinance on Flood and Storm Control in 1993 stipulates that at all levels throughout the country from central, provincial to district and commune, a Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Control shall be established. In emergency cases, the Prime Minister and the chairmen of the People’s Committees of all levels may mobilize all forces, supplies and means of any associations and individuals to rescue people, projects and properties threatened or damaged by floods and storms and shall take responsibility for their decisions. Vietnam has compiled a National Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention, Response and Mitigation to 2020, an Action Plan Framework for Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change in the Agriculture and Rural Development Sector and has adopted National Target Programmes in response to climate change. Multi stakeholders and community participants have been increasingly prioritised in the national target programmes. The 2010 World Development Report explicitly acknowledge that local communities typically precede national government in disaster response and adaptation, and much research has documented the importance of local institutions in livelihood adaptation in the wake of disasters. Accordingly, the Vietnamese government initiated several initiatives to improve local collaboration. At the time of our research, the government allocated 1 trillion VND (appr. 45 million USD) projects aimed at raising community awareness in disaster risk management. Our research group was involved in a project on the local implementation of a participatory information system aimed to integrate and spatialize multi- and inter-disciplinary scientific and technological knowledge with indigenous experiences to improve the preparedness of the community.
Historically, the management structures clearly have build on authority and expertise that extend from the central level down to the provinces. The CPV was present in the lower governance tiers and dominated all aspects of flood preparedness. By this very structure, interdependence between the actors – at the local and national level – was considerable as will be further substantiated in the next question. The incentives to cooperate, however, even for the local associations, were determined by the central government. Thus, the collaboration built on asymmetric power relations between the central government with the financial, institutional and political resources and then the local communities.   
Again, we did not observe any major changes over time in the research period. On the contrary, the fundamental top-down governance structure in disaster management remained the same.

There is no national law on food security or the right to food in Vietnam’s legislative framework. Vietnam does not have specific judicial procedures to deal with violations of rights to food, and it does not have a separate, independent institution to enforce rights to food in the country. Instead, the government supplies food and other necessities in emergency cases at its discretion. In the absence of a rights-based approach, such as rights to land, livelihoods or food security, rural people do not perceive of state support as other than situational endowments, such as in emergencies after disasters. Thus, the vulnerable households did not perceive disaster relief from the authorities as a right. The respondents expressed hope that they would receive immediate relief in the event of a disaster; they further hoped to receive some monetary compensation for the destruction caused by floods; and they hoped soon to be eligible for new and more disaster-resilient housing. However, the immediate help during disasters (evacuation, food, shelter and water), as well as the rebuilding efforts (compensation and rebuilding of physical infrastructure), were clearly not rooted in ideas of state obligation and citizen’s rights.
The Vietnamese collaborative approach to disaster management is top-driven, with a clear focus on gauging the biophysical impacts of floods. Policies are mostly communicated down to the provincial government without clear plans and guidelines necessary to support implementation. There are clear vertical structures and hierarchies in the Vietnamese disaster management that confine and standardise initiatives along the more technocratic dimensions of the mainline ministries. Both the survey and additional interviews asserted that there is no encouragement for local people to organize spontaneously in order to carry out adaptation measures such as dikes, pooling of resources, protective forest belts, joint house-building, and the like. The local associations were not only dependent on the central government; they were an extension of the central government. This impacted the form of the collaborative governance. The governance structures tended to rely on command-and-control systems that resemble military operations and exclude participation; they sidelined local power structures and leave local people and institutions out of the community rebuilding process, making recovery more difficult; and they ignored local people’s social and livelihood needs with the result that vulnerable groups may be left even more disadvantaged.
Community collaboration outside the realm of the CPV associations and agencies was modest. Relatives and neighbours played a very marginal role in coping with floods. Formal organizing was weak, while at the same time non-state actors were few and far between: ‘civil society’ development remains a sensitive issue. Neither traditional institutions such as Buddhist temples and lineage organization, nor new civil society organizations have great rooms of manoeuvre in disaster management. They work closely with public authorities and in accordance with government programs as is the norm in Vietnam. Interestingly, vulnerable households did not appear to pay much attention to the source of the disaster relief. Households were oblivious to whether the disaster relief they had received came from the state on one side or from domestic NGOs (for instance the Buddhist Associations) or international NGOs (for instance Oxfam and Red Cross) on the other. The fact that assistance from the state was not perceived to be qualitatively different from that of other sources is a direct consequence of most NGOs having to operate through state institutions.  
Again, we did not observe any significant changes in the institutional architecture of collaboration over time.

While reforms aimed at decentralisation and strengthening grassroots democracy have accelerated during the last decades, the Vietnamese local governance system is still characterised by limited fiscal devolution, as well as a lack of transparency and accountability. There was limited local authority autonomy. The central government continues to set tax rates and determine tax bases; the tax administration is still nationally centralised; and there continues to be heavy interference by central government in sub-national spending programmes. Central agencies keep control over the process of decision-making of local organs. The CPV strives to bring its governmental agencies as close as possible to the people and the villages in order to consolidate their organisational base. One of the chief means of rural consolidation and control is the Fatherland Front, an umbrella group encompassing the many different CPV mass-associations including the Farmers’ Union, Women’s Union, the War Veterans’ Association and the Youth Unions. In this way, the CPV stretches downwards through the government tiers into most aspects of rural organisation. Decentralisation in Vietnam has been interpreted as being more of an exercise of power than a devolution of power. The state administrative apparatus is interpenetrated by the Party apparatus at all levels of governance.
Local associations are essentially political mass-organizations. Ninety-five percent of respondents in our study answered that members of their household were involved in formal associations. Only 6% reported being members of other organisations than the seven major mass-organisations tied to the CPV. These various formal mass-associations were increasingly being activated in preparing for floods. Interviewed members of the Farmers Union told us that they were part of village rescue teams, and the Women’s Association had been involved in information dissemination and rescue teams when a major flood had occurred. These initiatives, however, were limited in scope and the active involvement (including training exercises) was restricted to a small portion of the surveyed/interviewed households. In addition, all activities were undertaken in close collaboration with the local commune, which functioned as an implementing agency. When asked about her greatest accomplishment in disaster management as head of the Women’s Association, for instance, the head replied that it was to get people to follow the government’s policies. 
The leadership, in terms of initiative, design and implementation, primarily rested with the CPV. This produces a unique form of collaborative governance between the central government and local associations/communities during floods. From one perspective, the governance is impressive when considering the reach and swiftness of the flood relief. The collaborative dimension of governance, though, is largely absent, which results in subpar flood relief for many vulnerable households. 
We did not observe any fundamental changes over time. 
";2;2;2;Off;5;5;5;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;2;2;2;Off;1;1;4;Off;4;2;4;2;4;Off;Off;1;4;2;4;Off;Mostly confident;"An impressive rate of 93% of respondents reported receiving support from the local authorities during years when flooding struck. In-kind support (mainly clothes and food) was the predominant type of support received by 98% of those who got relief from the local authorities, 30% received cash, and less than 1% got a loan. Respondents were also asked to identify the most important sources of assistance when coping with natural disasters or other kinds of distress: 73% of the respondents pointed to relief from the local government, while only 4% of the respondents identified neighbours as an important (not even the most important) source for disaster protection. In essence, government relief is an essential part of coping strategies for vulnerable communities faced with recurrent floods. These statistics could surely be framed as an example of effective disaster governance. Surely, the reach and the swiftness with which relief could be distrusted was impressive for a lower-middle income country such as Vietnam. The collaborative nature of this type of governance, however, was limited. Our empirical evidence indicated a limited role of the local community in the collaborative governance of disaster relief. While local authorities were indeed actively preparing for floods, the nature of the collaboration was mainly restricted to act as subnational implementation units. Respondents referred to “announcements” as the single most important activity for the community associations. Announcements were almost exclusively conducted by loudspeakers while only a small minority of the respondents referred to announcements disseminated during community meetings where some participatory inputs could be gathered. Announcements are, in general, a top-down-driven form of communication and in the case of loudspeakers they are unequivocally also a one-way communication form. Only 2% of our respondents emphasized experience/information sharing as an activity in the collaboration with the government.  An overwhelming majority (more than 90%) described local meetings that could best be characterized as fora for state announcements and information dissemination. People were in their own words “reminded”, “informed”, “encouraged” and physically “moved”. Cumbersome administrative processes hampered any actual feedback. Suggestions needed to be in writing and pass through several bureaucratic layers. Such processes were beyond most vulnerable and unconnected households. The collaboration was mainly a mechanism for control and implementation rather than actual deliberation of policy. 
Accordingly, key government agencies considered flooding an exogenous natural hazard that can be forecasted and then dealt with through dikes, higher bridges, water reservoirs, and resilient infrastructure—what has been referred to as “climate proofing.” The remaining social problems are mainly dealt with through in-kind relief aid. With regard to the specific nature of disaster preparation, a small minority (12%) of respondents emphasized disaster management initiatives that could be interpreted as rooted in civil society, such as coordinating local meetings, sharing best-practices, streamlining village self-help groups, and participating in community rescue plans. The vast majority of the respondents (62%), however, emphasized state-led disaster policies, such as the provision of better roads, drainage, dikes/dams and housing. The qualitative interviews also pointed to state-led preparatory activities that were mostly related to physical infrastructure, such as preparing equipment, stacking sand bags, strengthening dikes and houses, providing loans for safe-houses, relocating people and deepening the waterways. The point here is not to denounce the importance of information dissemination or investments in physical infrastructure as part of an effective disaster management strategy. Rather, it is to uncover the asymmetric collaborative nature of governance with respect to disaster response. The result was top-down preparatory efforts that emphasize the physical infrastructure side of disaster management, with little involvement of the local communities. 
With respect to changes over time, the centre-led collaborative governance process fundamentally remained the same despite an increased focus on participation and increased funding for community-led disaster management.";3;3;3;Off;2;2;2;Off;4;4;4;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;2;5;5;5;2;2;2;2;2;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"In the Vietnamese case, I feel this question will mostly be a repetition of my previous answers. Naturally, this type of governance collaboration was limited in terms of electoral pressure, NGOs and CSOs involvement, oversight and accountability. The goals were formulated and monitored by the CPV. The state-led mass organizations had a near monopoly on rural organization, and any voluntarism was channeled through these mass organizations. In fact, households were often unaware of national policies and procedures related to disaster preparedness and planning: 49% of our respondents were unaware of national policies and procedures and 72% of interviewees did not know about disaster plans that were implemented at the community or commune level.  The strong bureaucracy, top-down initiated policies and limited political accountability spurred a high degree of interaction with formal communities in disaster settings as well as high rates of memberships in political associations. However, the nature of the collaboration inhibited community-led participation, synergetic cooperation, and risk sharing at the local level. Thus, this type of collaborative governance might provide effective disaster relief through a quick and extensive mobilization of resources. But the disaster initiatives were not right-based and were not the result of bottom-up dialogue and stakeholder consultations. The interaction between local authorities and vulnerable households was substantial in quantitative terms. In qualitative terms, however, the close collaboration was not based on enforceable rights or electoral accountability. The result was disaster management that was mainly technocratic, focused on climate proofing through the construction of dykes, higher bridges, water reservoirs, resilient infrastructure and so on. The socio-economic disaster aid mostly consisted of short-term relief (food, clothes and shelter) whereas longer-term aid to bolster resilience to the recurrent floods received less attention.  

Finally, the template has been constructed with a liberal democratic government in mind. This is, of course, most obvious when the template mentions “elected politicians” but it also creeps up in some of the other overarching questions. This focus is obviously the right choice considering the sample of countries that you will include. However, at times it made a bit difficulty for me to convey the true nature of the collaboration in the multiple choice questions. I hope these descriptions provides enough contextual information to allow you to interpret the template in the right way.

Interestingly, there is a significant positive relationship among the victims of floods between the importance placed on disaster relief from the local authorities on the one hand and then whether households received the disaster relief on the other. This could be indicative of good targeting in that those who deem state relief important are likely to receive it.   Both the objective indicators of disaster management (did you receive support and what kind?) and subjective indicators (rate the importance and usefulness of the support) point to a success in terms of disaster management. The outcomes, therefore, in terms of goal achievement and legitimacy can only be deemed high. However, this type of collaboration is also indicative of a strong dependence on disaster relief from local authorities. The state-led mass organizations have a near-monopoly on rural organization, and any voluntarism is channeled through these mass-organizations. Forms of collaboration are not formed by bottom-up processes of community self-organization and reaching out but through top-down processes where the state has annexed and institutionalized important civil society spaces. The relations of power and control over the collaborative processes are highly skewed in favor of the local authorities. This has implications for the collaborative network’s problem-solving capacity. Disaster management was primarily perceived as a technical issue. Disaster protection concentrated on reducing physically determined vulnerability with limited attention to the socially determined vulnerability. The social dimension was reduced to emergency aid (rice, drinking water and shelter) while longer-term social policies, catering to the specific needs of the communities, were limited. Recall, that less than one percent of the recipients of relief received loans. Community resilience, thus, did not increase over time.  

On the contrary, in terms of ‘unintended’ consequences, the state centered collaboration crowed out other forms of civil society, bottom-up driven collaborations. Interviews with vulnerable households did not only indicate a substantial reliance on the local authorities for disaster protection, but they also revealed a weak reliance on other forms of collaboration during floods. Relatives and neighbors appear to only play a very modest role in coping with disasters, and more than 80 percent of the respondents rated aid from relatives and neighbors as irrelevant during disasters.  We did not find a single erected safe-house where the building had been cooperative effort between the villagers; what would have been equivalent to ‘barn raising.’ Even minor constructions such as higher ledges (to store food in-house) were a private matter. Simple communal collaboration efforts such as sharing of boats as a protection against major floods also did not appear to take place. The weak basis for civil society collaboration and the reliance on state support during and in the immediate aftermath of flooding leave very little scope for communal participation and local knowledge sharing. Vulnerable households risked being squeezed between the adverse consequences of the actual floods and then the centralized disaster management efforts that provided immediate relief but little in terms of longer-term community development and resilience building.

It was aimed as a pilot project for a new Integrated Water Resources Management policy that intended to improve land allocation for the better management of a catchment´s resources, as well as to prevent floods and increased water scarcity resulting from the impacts of climate change in the catchment. It included the development of specific projects, the conduction of risk assessment to inform land use allocation and the development of rules for water use with greater detail for the Guacaica sub-catchment. 

(2) The official goal of the asosciation agreement signed by the department of Caldas' regional enviornmental agency (Corpocaldas), the regional branch of Colombia´s largest, public university (Universidad Nacional) and the national asociation of all regional environmental agencies (Corponor) was to ""Join economic, technical and financial efforts for the integrated management of hydric resources in the Chinchina Catchment of the department of Caldas"". The specificexpected outputs were to develop a plan for resource use priroritization and managememt of the Chinchina River Catchment, regulating water use at a specific sub-catchment (the Guacaica river), a water users´census and developing for flood prevention in specific areas that could be incorporated in the specific land plannning instruments in each of the municiplaities in the catchment. The poutcome would be a better management of the catchment, preventing further water stress as well as floods and other water-related disasters. 

(3) The original issues did not change during a period that, if not too short (32 months) was however also not so long. This was also a project, where tasks are supposedly more specified and leaving less room for change than in a policy. 
My reserach was not tuned to identify changes in those ambitions, but I didn note a change in the Universidad Nacional´s ambition of a highly horizontal collaboration ";4;4;Independently convened by a third party;4;4;Off;3;3;3;3;3;3;Off;Off;3;Highly confident;"(1) Universidad Nacional is a frequent partner for Corpocaldas -the regional environmental agency in the department of Caldas that included the Chinchina catchment. At the same time, Corpocaldas is both a member of Asocars -the regional environmental agencies´ association- and the regional implementer of all environmental policies for the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS, Spanish acronym). Other organizations playing a role on this project -Ideam and IGAC- are not so often partners of the above mentioned actors, although they are often sources for information 
(2) The Dutch Embassy wanted to help finance the initial implementation of a new Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policy , adopted by Colombia in March 2010. The urgency of the policy became higher after a season of highly damaging floods in late 2010-early 2011 known as the “Ola Invernal” (Winter Wave). The Embassy and the Ministry agreed that the best way to implement the policy was through the regional environmental agencies that execute the national environmental policies but are governed by regional actors in each department (that was the role of Corpocaldas) but since those regional agencies often lacked highly qualified scientific personel and/or equipment, other, preferably local actors with such resources -that would often be universities- might be required (that was the role of Universidad Nacional). In the case of Chinchina, chose Universidad Nacional as its preferred technical partner, and they would be the main partners in the collaboration, with the Ministry in the role of providing guidance on specific issues and developing the legal framework for the catchment management plans, Asocars -the environmental agencies´association- creating teams for technical assistance to the four pilot projects, including Chinchina and also taking care of financial procedures, and other government agencies like the National Hydrology and Meteorology Institute (Ideam) and the National Geographic Institute (IGAC) providing informational needed for decision-making.
(3) Perceived interdependence was high between Universidad Nacional and Corpocaldas, as well as between Corpocaldas and Asocars. Neither the Ministry nor any other of the national organizations (Ideam, IGAC) had such a sense of interdependence. Although I did not measure “incentives”, a long history of joint projects between Corpocaldas and Universidad Nacional justified their interest in keeping the relationship alive trough some degree of collaboration, while organizations at the national level seemed to have a low interest on collaborating 
(4) Although my research design does not address changes in time in the dynamics of the collaborations, nothing in the narrative interviews conducted, the documents analyzed of the answers to the initial research questionnaire suggest changes in perceived interdependence over time

(1) The collaboration  was mostly driven by the dynamics between Universidad Nacional -in charge of drafting the Pomca documents- and Corpocaldas -in charge of adopting the Pomca, with all its planning, proposed projects and regulation/water allocation components. However, and despite this being a pilot project, Corpocaldas could only act within the limits of the existing norms – and the interpretation of what would was within the norms would be made by the Ministry. Asocars was supposed to provide technical assistance but it was not so relevant to the final result in this domain, besides its perceived technical weakness, the frequent exchanges with the Ministry -Asocars was more relevant in providing spaces and methodologies for information exchanges and debates between the Chinchina and three other pilot project groups of actors in different zones of Colombia. 
One “ground rule” that became apparent only at an advanced phase in the project was that legal restrictions would be so strong that even when a step of the project had been completed, the modification of the norms governing it would lead to re-do the work -a restrictive governance mode for this collaboration
(2) Although all the three more constant members of the collaboration – the University (Universidad Nacional), the environmental agency (Corpocaldas) and the environmental agencies´ association (Asocars)- all had a voice in the key decisions made in a project´s “steering committee”, at some point in the initial stage it became clear that Asocars and Corpocaldas would evaluate Universidad Nacional’s performance and pay it accordingly -a relationship less horizontal than what the University expected. However, Universidad Nacional was a powerful voice in all the key debates in the collaboration -both joining forces to demand changes to a Ministry´s decision, like with the composition of the water governance bodies, or confronting it like in the risk assessment. It cannot be said that its voice was less powerful, since at the end of the project Corpocaldas had no alternative but to accept the land use allocation proposed by the University. The ministry, on the other hand, reserved itself to intervene in only the decisions more important to it, often imposing its opinions, but even it had to accept changes to those positions in some situations. 
(3) I have no information about the transparency of the decision-making 
(4) There were no significant changes in the institutional architecture during the collaboration

Universidad Nacional and Corpocaldas. They are not leaders because the exercised behaviour to try to influence others- (Leadership work) but because they had followers: what they proposed was accepted either by the other leader or by some other players. 
I call their style directive because they did not try to facilitate others´s participation, they just tried to get the collaboration  to do what they preferred. 

The leadership work was performed by a third party, Asocars, who created spaces for the exchange of opinions and proposed solutions to common problems of the four catchment management plans -including this one- thorugh worskhops in which different approaches were discussed also with the participation of the Ministry. 

Asocars, however, had no leadership of its own and was only relevant as a facilitator. Very seldom, if at all, in the meeting minutes analyzed does Asocars suggest an action to be taken in the project. And no other actor mentions it as a source of leadership. 

None of the leaders, nor Asocars for that matter, assumed roles of mediators -although Asocars seemingly took that role at the very end of the project to prevent the University-Corpocaldas standoff to lead to project to a failure. None of the actors played a stewards´ role. 

(2) the dynamics and impact of leadership on the collaborative process: 

Actor representatives interviewed on this collaboration do not consider leadership a very relevant factor affecting the results. As mentioned above, although the style was labelled as “directive” there was no evident effort by any of the actors to make others change their mind, but mainly to simply impose its interpretation on the grounds of technical knowledge and/or legal authority. 
The only actor that assumed a conscious role as facilitator, Asocars, lacked the leadership to extract from the debates and exchanges it organized conclusions that could be considered as “settling the discussions” by the other actors.  
(3) changes in the leadership dynamics in the period observed: 

Two changes were identified: One, the end of the Asocars´ sponsored workshops as of late 2013, when the Ministry adopted a series of “Guidelines” that in fact operated as norms for this and the other pilot projects implementing the IWRM policy, making debates seem useless. The other, towards the end of the collaboration, when it seems that Asocars´ intervened to avoid a likely failure of the project if Corpocaldas  did not accept Universidad Nacional´s land use allocation (zoning).

Although synergy is considered to be the key component of the “collaborative advantage” there was no specific effort made aimed at getting actors to share knowledge, or to do joint fact-finding, since the collaboration operated certainly as an association -none of the actors was hierarchically superior- but with differentiated roles: Universidad Nacional drafting, Corpocaldas approving, the Ministry vetting, and others (Asocars, IGAC) mainly “supporting”. 
So actors interacted mainly to present or evaluate (accept, reject) proposals, not trying to perform co-learning but to present their own knowledge or evaluate the validity of others´knowledge. 
The exception was, in part, Asocars through its role in facilitating exchanges and also in keeping the memory of the collaboration and identifying “lessons learned”. Asocars lacked, however, leadership among the others for this role to be considered relevant. 

(2) how they formulated and achieve shared outcomes: 
The outcomes of the project were formulated in a dual process, before the official start of the collaboration, between Asocars and MADS on the one hand, and Asocars, Corpocaldas and Universidad Nacional on the other hand. Although all the actors had to agree on the outcomes -perhaps with the exception of IGAC, who only was relevant as a source of information at some point- they did not really design the project together. 
Also, although the actors expected this to be a collaborative process, including joint decision-making at the steering committee, they tried to achieve the outcomes mostly through the addition of their individual efforts, each one from its role. 

(3)  how the process changed over the period observed: 

The process did not change during the period observed in relation to the dimensions discussed in this section

The collaboration was legally an “association agreement” between Corpocaldas, Universidad Nacional and Asocars to execute a project for which terms of reference (TOR) were drafted and approved beforehand. The specific goals of the collaboration were set through agreements between those three parties, although they were aligned with common goals agreed for all of the Pomcas (catchment management plans) within a larger, umbrella project, called “Project Netherlands”. 

All of the Pomcas had to be executed in six phases:   
Pre-preparations signing of legal agreements between the parts, work groups would be formed within each agency to work on its water management plan, and the catchment would be declared “in ordination”. 
Preparations including the hiring of external technical teams to support regional environmental agencies, compiling secondary information and cartography, and carrying out stakeholder analyzes to identify those that should be part of a catchment governance  body (Catchment Council). 
Diagnosis was about identifying a “base line” for the basin, analysing its situation in regard to demand and supply of renewable natural resources (with an emphasis on water) 

Foresight phase aimed at identifying a trend scenario, a desired future and a desired-possible one 
In the environmental zoning phase decisions on land use would become concrete, “identifying the different homogeneous units of territory and the categories of environmental use for each one”, all of this following the guidelines from the Ministry of the Environment. 
Formulation , where both investments and norms necessary to reach the plan’s goals would be identified. Projects, budget sources and follow up and evaluation mechanisms would be defined, while simultaneously specific streams would be prioritized for the definition of the riparian zones on their sides, forests would be singled out where timbering should be restricted and, where necessary, water rights would be assigned. 
Progress was monitored by Asocars through a procedure for determining each tasks´ weight within a given phase and estimated completion times for each phase. Progress was discussed in steering committees and was the main criteria to decide on payments to Universidad Nacional -not to other parties because they were contributing most, although not all, of the financial resources.

(2) how participants, elected officials, oversight bodies, and citizens held the collaboration to account

There are no reports of a role of elected officials in the collaboration. Although they do elect the director general of Corpocaldas and may have indirect influence over the University, Asocars and the Ministry, they seem to have played no role.
Affected groups were relevant in the fate of other two projects within Project Netherlands -another Pomca and the flood prevention plan- but not in this one, where there´s no account of them pressing decisions and the water governance body that was created was used mainly for fathering information for citizens and for providing information to them, not for decision-making. 
Oversight bodies, on the other hand, seem to have been the major reason why high trust between the main parties did not lead to a smooth collaborative process. 
As one member of the Corpocaldas team put it in an interview: 

Cooperation with the University was more of a contractual issue, although we wanted it to be more horizontal.

governance process

The results of the process were modest. Although the collaborative project was completed and the Pomca adopted by the regional environmental agency, there was no progress in co-learning between members of the collaboration and, were they to face a similar collaboration, it is likely that the same kind of issues and disagreements may emerge. There are no indications of changes in perceptions of interdependence, on leadership or on shared problem definitions. Also Asocar´s workshops and effort to identify lessons learnt are well regarded, there is no indication that any of the actors is adopting this practice. 
The project itself was completed with a significant delay (68% in months thatr are made worse by the fact that it was completed without Corpocaldas really accepting part of the results, which led it to re-do part of the analysis afterwards). This means that additional resources were needed to complete it. 

(2) the outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and 
legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences

(Joint) problem-solving capacities of the actors did not change as a result of the lack of co-learning. The goals were partly achieved (the Pomca was completed and adopted by Corpocaldas, just without any social support gained through a public value creation process, and therefore with no more legitimacy than other plans/projects put in place by the environmental agency). There are no accounts of specific unintended positive or negative consequences identified in my research 

(3) the changes to collective outputs and social outcomes over time
No changes identified, with the exemption that collaboration became more scarce in the last months of the project, when the Ministry´s mandatory ""Guidelines” rendered even Asoscar´s workshops for discussing options seemingly useless.

It was estimated to affect almost one in four women in long-term relationships during their lifetime and each year since 2000, Victoria Police had recorded more than 20,000 incidents. This, according to experts, was only the tip of the iceberg; research suggested that as many as 80 percent of cases went unreported. Family violence was one of the most confronting and complex aspects of police work. It was responsible for approximately 30 percent of police callouts; more than a third of those were repeat visits. When police were called out to an incident the approach police took was often superficial and focused on calming the immediate situation. Even though police had the capacity to take out intervention orders against offenders themselves, there were legal hurdles and considerable paperwork; it wasn’t an option that was routinely pursued. Where offenders breached existing intervention orders, they frequently weren’t investigated or prosecuted. Incidents were often considered in isolation, without considering the history of the relationship or the needs of secondary victims such as children. The choice for victims of family violence was either to go to police “and get a fairly poor response”, or to go to an NGA for usually short term support. Two pathways and two different systems meant women and children’s safety could easily fall into the gaps between.

(2) In late 2001, new Police Commissioner Christine Nixon announced three key areas she wanted to focus on: burglary, motor vehicle theft and violence against women. She assigned an assistant commissioner (Leigh Gassner)  to the latter – specifically family violence and sexual assault who chose to first go and speak to community-based agencies before consulting widely within the police organisation. While Gassner was conducting these consultations, he also approached the head of the Office of Women’s Policy about a joint effort to bring government and non-government agencies involved in family violence together. Through their respective Ministers the two government agencies then went to the Social Policy Committee of Cabinet and asked for two statewide steering committees to be formed: one on reduction of sexual assault; and the other on family violence. The Committee agreed to both and gave police and the Office of Women’s Policy the leadership role on the latter. The NGAs were keen to be involved. During mid-2002, work began on the Statewide Steering Committee to Reduce Family Violence. The aim was to achieve a multi-agency and integrated response to the issue. (Meanwhile, the police began work on producing a Victoria Police Code of Practice for investigating family violence.) 

(3) The first, and in some respects the most difficult task was deciding how many participants to bring in and who they should be. There were literally hundreds of different service providers, some with only four-figure grants and each with its own perspective. there was a lot of friction between the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the NGAs who were largely funded by DHS. The Department was also worried about NGAs driving the agenda. The Department of Justice was the other main government participant to join the Steering Committee, along with the Departments of Human Services and Victorian Communities. As time went on participants on the Committee began documenting the problems and working on possible solutions in a report entitled: Reforming the Family Violence System in Victoria. The Steering Committee faced a setback when the Government declined the first funding application which disheartened members. But they were successful upon their second attempt.";2;2;Self-initiated by participants;1;1;Off;2;3;1;4;3;5;Off;Off;5;Highly confident;"Re (1) and (2), see item 14, points 2 and 3. 

Additional information: 

- The collaboration was initiated through the co-leadership of the new Police Commissioner, who authorized an assistant commissioner to exercise the power to convene and display the facilitative leadership required, enlist other government agencies, and ultimate co-lead the process along with the Office of Women's Policy (Vic Dept of Communities). The Commissioner also used her clout to keep the pressure on the issue, open doors in high places etc. 

-  The early stage of the Committee process  was about building relationships because there was a lot of mistrust from the service providers, stemming from their deep sense of disappointment at years of police indifference (as well as from misunderstanding the nature and limits of police powers in this domain) and seeming lack of interest and/or funding clout from other government departments. The challenge was often around having government and NGAs on a committee which is trying to come together and co-design a model that it wanted to put forward to government. But some of those representatives were also service providers, so they had a vested interest as well as wanting to get good outcomes for women and children. There initially was a lot uncertainty within the government agencies about they could work with the NGA's in a collaborative way without raising expectations that might not be met.

Re (3) Prior to Commissioner Nixon's intervention, there was no 'system' as such, just disjointed efforts by government agencies and NGA's, each in their own domain. The essence of the case is about the participants gradually becoming committed to forming a system, grasping their intedependence and finding political/budgetary momentum to start working in a more holistic fashion.

Re (4) Not really, The Committee's composition was stable throughout much of this period, and there was also political stability (a Labour state government, the continued presence and commitment of the police commissioner etc.).";6-okt;1-mei;1-mei;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;3;Off;4;1;3;4;Off;4;2;4;4;4;Off;4;Off;Mostly confident;"(1) The building up of mutual trust coming off a very low base of either not knowing much about, not appreciating one another's roles/powers/capabilities, or not trusting one another's motives (government actors fearing the NGA's would use the Committee to boost funding claims). Hence the ground rule was: tell it like it is; each actor was to be open about their own operations, their understanding of the problem, their responsibilities, their capabilities, the limitations of their remit, the frustrations they experience in dealing with the issues.

(2) The question of inclusiveness was a big one for this network. On the government side, it was relatively, both the justice/ law enforcement and human services/communities complexes needed to be represented. The question was at which level of seniority. Given that the setting up of the steering committee was directly authorized by the Victorian Cabinet, and given the personal example and diplomacy of Christine Nixon, the police commissioner, the Committee ended up being composed of agency heads. Below that level, there was the added complexity of the structure of the DHS where various sections were involved with family violence, e.g. Office of Housing and Office of Children. On the NGA side, the first, and in some respects the most difficult task was deciding how many participants to bring in and who they should be. There were literally hundreds of different service providers, some with only four-figure grants and each with its own perspective. NGAs were solving problems locally which meant that no two responses to women were the same. This approach would never address the widespread and brutal culture of family violence. The family violence sector has always thought that it was battling it out on its own. There were poor relations right across the board really reflecting a broken service system.” A/C Gassner recalls: “we tried to pick those peak bodies that could represent as much as possible the agencies that were on the ground dealing with family violence. It was hard because at a certain point we had to draw a line in the sand otherwise we would have needed the Rod Laver arena for meetings.” Nonetheless, there were still many voices to be heard and reaching a common understanding of the issues was proving to be incredibly challenging. 

(3) Given these complexities and sensitivities, procedural propriety and highly transparent processes were deemed essential. Gassner quickly realised that getting everyone to reach a common understanding was going to take longer than he thought. The two-hour monthly meetings soon extended to three. Said Gassner: “These issues involve so many disparate viewpoints and perspectives about how they should be handled and they’re all right to an extent but there was a need to bring them together. At
meetings I used to forget the agenda because it just got to a point where I realised that certain discussions had never been had before. And I just had to let it run. Some of the people from government agencies were very personally affronted by what they were hearing but it needed to get out.” As time went on participants on the Committee began documenting the problems and
working on possible solutions in a report entitled: Reforming the Family Violence System in Victoria. Despite the growing connections and sense of common understanding, preparing the document was still a long, tortuous process.  NGAs were still struggling to enunciate their aims and principles and incorporate them in a model. 

(4) I have let the case terminate in mid 2006 when the steering committee was disbanded, after its funding bid was successful and it was deemed that the newly engineered 'system' was now going to into an implementation phase. [what happened in the years thereafter could be a second case in its own right]. But for the duration of the current case period, the governance structure and the suite of actors represented on it were stable.

This was very much a case of distributed facilitative leadership:
- The catalytic role of strategic agenda-setting (raising the salience of the issue, demonstrating the police's commitment to 'clean up its act - which it duly did by adopting in 2004 a new Code of Practice for the handling of family violence, which brought much improvement to the police's operations in this domain, though many deep-seated institutional and cultural challenges remained) and the convenor role were very much played by Police Commissioner Christine Nixon, who used her hard and soft powers to the full extent to raise the temperature on the issue and personally vouch for the integrity of the police's effort to lead a collaborative approach.
- The mediation and stewardship roles were played by Gassner and his small team, eventually working in close conjunction with the Rhonda Cumberland at the Office of Women's Policy, who observed about Gassner: “We were surprised that an officer in Gassner’s position could pick up people’s needs very quickly and steer the relationship building as well as he did.” 

(2) Gassner discovered that many agencies were working under false assumptions, not only about what the police could do but what other services did. Gassner's low-key, empathetic style proved crucial in him credibly performing the mediation role to all parties' satisfaction, which resulted in them becoming and remaining committed to the collaborative process even while it was acrimonious at times, time-consuming all the time, and suffered some important setbacks initially.  

(3) In 2005, Cumberland took up a position with the Department of Victorian Communities and was confident that there was a whole-of government commitment to genuine improvement. While Victoria Police still occupied an important leadership position, DVC had now taken a bigger role especially in coordinating the activities of larger government departments such as DHS and Justice. “The priority is the system, that it is strong and that it will do what it says it will do so that women can have confidence in it,” said Cumberland. She acknowledged that it was difficult to operate a system across departments but felt they were making good progress: “When we check our thinking against Australian and international standards we are ahead in some areas and behind in others. But we are quite pleased with how we are travelling. The government has provided continuing vision and leadership, knowing that we are seeking generational change.”

Re (2): After the initial 'downloading' and trust-building period, the main focus of activity was to jointly draft the  Reforming the Family Violence System in Victoria report.This in turn not only provided the first stab at creating a whole of system strategic framework, but then also became central to the funding bid the Committee wanted to bring to Cabinet. Without a significant boost in funding, the collaborative effort would be dead in the water. The first funding bid was, however, shot down by the Treasury department. The case for funding was made mainly in moral and social terms, not in economic and public policy terms.

Re (3): Two significant and strategically commissioned and targeted reports were released in 2004 which changed the way the Government  viewed the significance of family violence. One report by Vic Health, supported
by DHS, looked at the contribution of family violence to Victoria’s disease burden and the
results were startling. It found that intimate partner violence accounted for nine percent of the
total disease burden for women aged 15-44, contributing more than obesity, illicit drugs and
alcohol. Intimate partner violence had a considerable impact on mental health
outcomes such as anxiety, depression and suicide. The other report, by Access Economics,
estimated the total cost of domestic violence to the Australian economy during 2002-2003
was in the region of $8 billion. This included costs to future generations. It was
estimated that there had been more than 400,000 victims of domestic violence who bore the
greatest share of the costs, however, the expense to state and federal governments was placed
at over $1 billion that year. These reports spoke language Cabinet could understand and in 2005 funding was secured, and thus the second main objective of the Committee was achieved.

Re (1) At the outset there was no formal goal-setting process. It was all about relationship-building with a view towards eventually doing better for the victims of family violence. However, once the Committee got underway, it became clear that it had two key milestones to achieve: 
(a) conceptualizing what an integrated response to family violence would look like in systemic terms. The Feb 2005 Report mentioned earlier delivered this. It proposed an integrated service delivery model (Exhibit D)
and the establishment of a state-wide Family Violence Advisory Committee along with
regional and local Governance Committees to facilitate cooperation and ensure consistency.  
(b) achieve a major funding injection in what had always been a chronically underfunded 'sector'. The was achieved in the 2005/6 budget.

Re (1) and (2) For the Committee's 2 main objectives and their achievement, see the text in the previous box re (1). In addition, as predicted, the number of family violence incidents rose because of increased public confidence that reporting now made sense and would elicit a substantive response. It reaching almost 30,000 during 2004-2005 according to police statistics. The following year, there was a slight decrease in incidents, then a rebound in reports in most regions during 2006-2007. NGA feedback indicated that the police response had significantly improved. And at the coalface, individuals and groups were forging better linkages. Cumberland
recalled that, “we saw new possibilities. We met at the local police station to develop a joint response to transporting unsafe women and children. Most women enter refuge services at night. Typically, they arrive by taxi and there were times when they were followed. Now we had made arrangements for women to be dropped off at 24 hour police stations, dramatically improving their level of safety.”

(3) Cumberland had observed major improvements: “You still hear haunting stories – police taking too long to respond, or high risk women returning home or the problems of indigenous communities where family and community violence intersect. But there is no turning back. The government has significantly invested in reform, the police continue to lead and support services are gradually changing. The courts too have pushed their own boundaries. There are still complaints about uneven responses but
change is happening on the ground.” Gassner also hoped for improved judicial responses including more streamlined process but
that notwithstanding, he reported that police were now taking out significantly more intervention orders. The number of criminal charges laid was also up, jumping by 73 percent in the first year alone. Between 2004 - the introduction of the
Victoria Police Code of Practice - and 2009 there had been a:
• 168% increase in the number of intervention orders applied for by police;
• 153% increase in charges laid; and a
• 22.4% increase in offences arising from breaches of intervention orders.
In addition, Victoria Police had since employed eleven family violence advisors and rolled
out a wide-ranging education program for officers. Gassner noted an attitudinal change shift
from tolerating the Code of Practice to embracing it: “Many members understand it, know
why it is there and are moving into it.” Steendam believed that although there was still a way
for police to go yet, that the increased number of reports was an encouraging sign. But the
next challenge was to reduce the number of repeat visits and free more families from the
cycle of violence.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After deficits came under control, the central government returned to the issue of affordable housing and homelessness with their National Homelessness Initiative (NHI), but at a significantly reduced spending rate, and thus time emphasized a partnership model to address these issues whereby local government and civil society groups and service providers in 60+ cities in Canada would be incentivized, with federal dollars, to come together to form a plan to address homelessness and would jointly decide how to spend those federal dollars supporting homelessness services delivered by non-profit organizations. 

The stated objectives were for local stakeholders to form “community advisory boards” (CABs) that would collaborate to develop a locally-specific plan to address homelessness and this group would also make decisions on how to invest the federal government’s dollars towards this effort. The requirement to form a CAB made up of diverse actors from civil society, non-profit and local government was part of an intentional effort to get the broader community to sit down together to discuss, debate and form a consensus around what ought to be the priorities for investments intended to address homelessness. The programs funded had to receive matched funding from other levels of government or organizations working in the field, and thus it was structurally designed to force organizations to work together, partner and collaborate in the provision of services at the local level. This sought to address a key problem of service providers working in isolation of each other and, sometimes, in a competitive position with each other in terms of accessing public dollars to support their programs. Thus, there are two levels of collaboration in this case: collaboration at the level of homelessness policy planning by key stakeholders and local government, and collaboration at the level of service provision.  

The ongoing challenge with collaborative governance in this context is that many of the actors involved in the collaboration which prioritizes investments and allocates government funds are the same people who may be vying for those funds. As such, there are procedures in place to avoid directly voting on one’s own programs for funding, but it does not eliminate the perceptions of conflicts of interest. It can be difficult for administrative managers of the collaboration to recruit and retain stakeholders who have no direct interest in the decisions. There is also frustration among some in the collaboration that they do a lot of collaborative work for relatively little money for programs at stake, and that the collaboration ought to pursue larger goals of encouraging the local governments to do more to address homelessness and to try to affect public opinion. The collaboration has thus evolved over the years, in particular shifting to a broader effort to mobilize local governments to do more and generate greater awareness among local citizens to the issues of homelessness (evolution captured in Doberstein 2016 UBC Press book).";2;1;Externally directed by law or authority;1;2;Off;5;4;3;3;2;4;Off;Off;4;Highly confident;"Prior to the creation of the National Homelessness Initiative (NHI) that incentivized the creation of collaborative governance groups at the local level in 60+ cities in Canada in 2000, there was virtually no local policymaking effort around homelessness in Canadian cities. The non-profit service sector was characterized by minimal cooperation, at times competitive relationships, and a lack of trust. Many reported that they often did not know what other organizations did in terms of services or how the collection of funded services across the city fit together as a whole. 

The NHI was created by the Government of Canada (GoC) in 2000 with collaboration and partnership in mind as a way to bring together local stakeholders to address the above problems, but also because they needed them to be the drivers of the policy response. A central part of the philosophy of the NHI was to create a national homelessness initiative not based an explicit set of policies determined by the GoC, but rather by allowing local communities to devise locally-specific responses to their unique needs. There are political reasons perhaps unique to Canada that in part drive this: the province of Quebec strongly resists the central government imposing policy directives on it or its cities, so the alternative of top-down policy directives was not  feasible. But there was also a sense that even if the GoC wanted to impose a country-wide homelessness policy directive, they were not equipped with the knowledge or expertise to devise such a policy, and that what may work for Vancouver may not work for Montreal, given the different conditions across the large country. The government was thus dependent on the expertise of local stakeholders to devise a plan and to help make funding decisions.  

Local communities would get access to NHI dollars for their city or region if they formed a local collaborative governance entity and developed a plan after consulting with the broader community. With a plan in place, they would then fund homelessness programs delivered by non-profit organizations consistent with the priorities identified in their plans. Thus local governments and stakeholders were incentivized to come together by new funding promised that they would have considerable delegated power in which to decide where that money flowed in the community. They had wide latitude to shape where that money went, with little direction from the GoC. These are the biggest draws among participants in the collaboration when interviewed. Most predicted when asked if that the collaboration would fold/collapse if the funding piece was withdrawn.  

Challenges to the collaboration arose when a new Conservative government came to power at the GoC in 2006 which began to add conditions on the funding envelope, in particular a mandate that 65% of the funding must be directed towards “Housing First” programs, which is one (of several) policy approaches in the field of homelessness. Many local collaborations around Canada balked at the new restrictions on their policy planning efforts, as it curtailed the collaborative efforts among the community to prioritize actions unique to their local needs. Yet in this case the GoC is applying a universal standard across all cities in the country, which challenged the local-ness of the collaboration and undermined the authority granted to the collaboration. This caused several collaborations to become very weak and membership to decline as the incentive to participate was dramatically lowered given the constraints on their independence from the govt.";20+;20+;20+;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;4;Off;5;2;2;4;Off;5;2;4;3;3;Off;4;Off;Highly confident;"The NHI by the Government of Canada (GoC) had several grounds rules for the local collaborations. It needed to be comprised of local government and stakeholders (ie. service providers, housing experts, mental health policy professionals, etc.), they needed to consult with the wider community and devise a local plan to address homelessness to be submitted to the relevant GoC Minister for approval. When determining how to allocate the funds provided to them by the GoC, they had to adhere to typical government standards: publicly post a call for program proposals, adjudicate the submissions in a consistent manner, and submit their recommendations to the GoC Minister. Much of this process would be overseen by a regional GoC staff member who worked with the local collaboration to make sure their activities aligned with GoC rules.  

The GoC placed few explicit rules on inclusiveness of the collaboration, but it was generally understood that there needed to be representatives from local non-profit service delivery organizations, as well as local government. Some local collaborations were large, with active membership exceeding 25 representatives (e.g. Vancouver), and others were relatively small, with about 7-10 (e.g. Toronto). The GoC would submit feedback to the collaboration after receiving their required annual reporting, which includes a list of their membership, if they felt the membership was insufficiently diverse, but there were no universal standards that the local collaborations had to meet in terms of inclusiveness.  

Decision-making in these collaborative venues across the country is transparent to the funder, the GoC, which has regional staff representatives present at all major decision moments, and typically even at the routine meetings throughout the year. But these collaborations are not transparent from the perspective of the community or citizens, as in many cases they are unadvertised meetings and decision meetings are closed to protect the information of service organizations who are under discussion. Although technically they are open to the public, there is little active transparency among these local collaborations whereby they promote their meetings, provide agenda items, and publish meeting minutes online. These can all be requested by a citizen through freedom of information protocols, although this may be costly and time-consuming. 

Various collaborations that were created in response to the NHI in Canadian cities have undergone considerable evolution in their institutional architecture since their creation in 2000. Some, like the collaboration in Vancouver, have at times oscillated from the collaboration’s board being the principal policy venue doing most of the work, to one in which a smaller set in an executive council meet more frequently and the larger board meets much less frequently (ie. a couple times per year). Others, like in Calgary, have remained very large, but with considerable turnover of representatives over the years. These institutional governance changes reflect the challenge of sustaining collaboration over a long period of time, with burnout, frustration, in-action, or otherwise as reasons for trying out new approaches. Yet the basic structures of governance as informed by the GoC as part of the enabling program have more or less remained constant since 2000. But how that is operationalized at the local level evolves at the margins.

The GoC leadership was largely structural in form, meaning set forth in governance procedures enforced by the GoC Minister through regional GoC staff. This leadership ensured that local collaborations adhered to the mandate set forth in the NHI program, namely that a group of local government and stakeholders formed the core collaborative body, that they produced a plan to address homelessness informed from community consultation and deliberation, and that the investments made by them using GoC funds were technically eligible (ie. not being directly towards non-homelessness initiatives). The ongoing leadership and oversight was conducted by regional GoC staff, often junior level bureaucrats, under the direction of the Ministry in Ottawa. This leadership form allowed for flexibility at times, given the nature of the program, but also was hampered by the GoC staff being junior and thus were in essence translators and interpreters of GoC procedures to the local level.

The other level of leadership was at the local collaborative level, which was typically a non-profit organization leader selected from among the membership of the collaborative to take the chair or co-chair position. This leadership has few executive responsibilities, and instead was an individual who would preside over the regular meetings of the collaborative and be in more frequent contact with administration staff in order to complete the administrative work required to fulfill the collaborative’s mandate. Chairs or co-chairs would often serve as the public face of the collaboration in media stories and advocacy efforts, as well as travel the country to learn about what other NHI collaboratives were doing with respect to governance, policy and programs.  

Leadership at the collaboration level often had few independent tools in order to facilitate more collaboration among the membership beyond the mandate of the NHI program, largely due to them not necessarily being a representative of a major government or societal entity that could incentivize change or collective will formation on policy. Their success would largely hinge on the personal characteristics and abilities to encourage further collaborative work and exchange. These are unpaid positions, and thus without secondment or any other mechanism to reduce their already high workload with their home organization, chair burnout occurred at times, or alternatively chairs would limit their work in the collaboration to the narrow mandates of the NHI funding program.

The Metro Vancouver homelessness collaboration issued a call for proposals for local homelessness and housing service providers to apply for funding of programmes for up to 2 years. The proposed programmes included providing outreach services, shelter and supports, transitional housing, mental health and addiction treatment, life skills programmes and youth safe houses, among others, across the Vancouver area. To review the proposed programmes and decide which among them to support as the policy response, the twenty-four members of the collaborative formed a special review committee, which would collectively deliberate and decide on the investment priorities. The decision-makers consisted of diverse civil society representatives from homelessness service providers, client group representatives (youth, Aboriginals, women) and community-based philanthropic organizations in four groups (each consisting of five to six members) to share the burden of reviewing the homelessness programme proposals. Each member individually reviewed and scored their group’s share of the proposed programmes and then all met collectively to deliberate which among them should be prioritized and receive investment. 

As a researcher, I was able to observe these deliberations as part of the decision-making process, as well as gain access to each decision-maker’s individual scoring sheets for each program proposal in order to analyze them. A major question I sought to examine is: Are collaborative governance deliberations actually transformative (such that actors change their perspectives)? After all participants completed their individual evaluations of the programme proposals assigned to their subgroup, they met collectively to discuss each programme, deliberated over their strengths and weaknesses before selecting those which would receive investment. Deliberations on each proposed programme ranged from 20 minutes to over an hour, followed by several hours of synthesizing and mapping out the service and policy landscape they were creating with their decisions. The deliberations were demonstrably transformative, as evidenced by Figure 2 in the PMR article, which shows how the initial rankings based on the aggregation of individual scores by the participants changed quite substantially after deliberations. 

The changing of minds in this context was not fundamentally characterized by compromise, but rather was about learning, persuasion and transformation. Examples identified from participant observation can help demonstrate how arguments were accepted, transformed or ejected from deliberations, and ultimately shifted the collective policy choices. In the deliberations, with some of the most significant shifts in ranking of preferred programmes, participants introduced new data and the perception of the value of the proposed programme changed among other members. New data included knowledge about what was happening on the ground (e.g. a shelter in the area is about to close), or correcting a misconception about the organization or proposed programme.

This process in terms of deliberations among collaboration members to arrive at funding decisions for homelessness programs remains largely the same over time, , which emphasizes community input and control into investment decisions.";5;5;5;Off;4;3;2;Off;4;4;5;Off;1;1;1;5;5;5;Off;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;5;3;2;1;4;4;5;5;4;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Highly confident;"The goals of the local collaborations are formulated at two levels: (i) the GoC core objectives to mobilize a community response to homelessness, and (ii) the particular priorities of a local collaboration informed by consultations and deliberations in the community that form the plan to address homelessness. On the first level, a key principle behind the GoC approach when this program was created in 2000 was to allow the local collaborations wide flexibility in terms of how and where they wished to invest homelessness funds after a community-driven process to shape policy priorities. Yet as mentioned in Question 21, challenges to the collaboration arose when a new Conservative government came to power at the Government of Canada in 2006 which began to add conditions on the funding envelope, in particular a mandate that 65% of the funding must be directed towards “Housing First” programs, which is one (of several) policy approaches in the field of homelessness. Many local collaborations around Canada balked at the new restrictions on their policy planning efforts, as it curtailed the collaborative efforts among the community to prioritize actions unique to their local needs. Yet in this case the Government of Canada is applying a universal standard across all cities in the country, which challenged the local-ness of the collaboration and undermined the authority granted to the collaboration. This caused several collaborations to become very weak and membership to decline as the incentive to participate was dramatically lowered given the constraints on their independence from the government.

On the second level of how goals of the collaborations are formulated and monitored—that is, at the local level—the local collaborative bodies, in advance of preparing or updating their community plans (which occurs every 5-10 years, depending on the particular city in Canada), typically engage in community forums, working groups, and other forms of engagement with stakeholders and individuals experiencing homelessness in order to help shape policy priorities for the plan. Much of this engagement is targeted to stakeholders, not the general public, however. 

Alongside the day-to-day supervision of the local collaborations by the GoC regional staff, as detailed above in Question 37, the chief formal mechanism of accountability is formal reporting to the GoC, the funder. The local collaboration’s membership and community plan, as well as their funding decisions, need to be formally approved by the relevant GoC Minister. In particular, the local collaboration required to produce a Community Plan Assessment (CPA) for the federal government outlining how the funding allocations are consistent with the priorities identified by the community and demonstrating the incremental impact of the program on homelessness in the locality. Various members of local collaborations in the country, and their administrative support staff, complain of the highly detailed and routine reporting required by the GoC for this program, given how little government funds are at stake in the grand scheme of GoC spending. 

Citizens are generally not aware of the activity of the local collaborations, as they are generally not publicized and their proceedings not subject to active transparency protocols.  Thus, accountability flows entirely “upward” to the GoC Minister, not “downward” to the community.  ";5;5;5;Off;1;1;1;Off;4;2;2;Off;1;1;1;Off;4;3;3;Off;Off;4;3;3;Off;3;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;4;3;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;4;3;1;1;1;5;4;3;Off;Off;Off;5;4;3;3;4;4;1;1;1;1;Off;1;1;Off;Off;;5;4;3;1;1;1;3;4;4;5;4;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Highly confident;"The outputs of the collaboration include (i) devising a community-informed and locally-specific plan to address homelessness, (ii) collective deliberations on how to invest GoC dollars in the region, (iii) additional spillover actions beyond the funding piece but emerge from being brought together in a collaborative space (ie. formulating Homelessness Action Week in Metro Vancouver, a community mobilization to raise awareness of homelessness as a problem in the region).

Perhaps the most observable outcomes of the collaboration from my research is when collaboration members come together to deliberate over whether to fund certain homelessness services and programs. I observed these deliberations and compared them to analogous funding decision-making in the absence of collaboration (ie. within a bureaucracy) and found that the process and outcomes are entirely different.  The collaborative environment of decision-making revealed that diverse community stakeholders involved in the collaboration think about homelessness rather differently from each other, which leads to productive and interesting discussions among them when brought together, often revealing misunderstandings or narrow thinking that is corrected as they deliberate.  Contrast this with government bureaucrats, which my PMR article revealed think about the issues and make assessments on proposed homelessness services and programs rather similarly; that is, there is a “collaborative advantage” when diverse local stakeholders come together to prioritize investments and make decisions, which is lost in alternative scenarios when bureaucrats control this process.  

Despite witnessing a “collaborative advantage” in decision-making regarding homelessness programs, the effects on the raw numbers of people experiencing homelessness are not detectable. In fact, homelessness continues to rise in virtually all Canadian cities. The local collaborations are not to blame for this, as they control only a fraction of the total funding and policy space as it relates to homelessness—in Canada, provincial governments are the real major players, with control over major funding sources related social assistance, affordable housing, homelessness services, etc. But the fact that the local collaborations are doing good work at mobilizing a more coordinated community response to homelessness, but homelessness continues to grow, can be frustrating for those involved in the collaboration, and can undermine the legitimacy of the collaboration itself among the public.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This plan fermented significant opposition in the local community of Vlaardingen, which resulted in ten thousand signatures against the country houses. The government subsequently decided not to take any action until 2010. Citizens wanted this area to remain undeveloped, to provide leisure, sport, and educational opportunities. They also proposed that they develop and maintain the area directly as a community organization. In response, the council agreed to provide more opportunity for local engagement and self-organization.  
 From 2007 to 2008, the citizen group took the lead to further elaborate the governance experiment in cooperation with the Mayor and Aldermen. They came up with the idea to develop a covenant to formalize agreements and conditions concerning the extent and form of the citizen initiative. The civil servant, alderman and leading citizens worked closely to jointly develop a policy note that later evolved into a social contract in which the citizens’ initiative (Federation Broekpolder) and its relationships with the municipality (civil service, Mayor and Alderman, and City Council) were elaborated (co-creation). 
 During 2009-March 2010, the Federation had the task of developing a formal plan - the Integral Area Development and Maintenance Plan - to (re)develop and maintain the area. The Plan was prepared and developed by prioritizing a few projects: The development of a core nature area, archaeological education center, activity forest, and small harbor. In this round, the citizen initiative was discussed a couple of times in the city council. The integral area plan developed was formally approved by the council, which was still obligatory. Moreover, a new regional manager was appointed by the municipality with the task of enhancing its relationship with the Federation. 
 During (April 2010-2011), a local government election took place. As a result, a new alderman was appointed to deal with the Broekpolder dossier. He was not in favor of this citizen initiative, and one of first things he did was to re-allocate the budget for the Broekpolder, making it no longer exclusive. He put this previously allocated money into a general budget for green area development, and it became harder for the Federation to get its ideas financed by the municipality. Their projects subsequently came to a halt. The interrelationship between the Federation and the municipality became troublesome (avoidance).
 In the next period (2011-2014), the alderman moved on for political reasons, and again a new alderman was appointed. This alderman has a more positive view of the Federation, revitalizing interaction between the Federation and the municipality. This connection was strengthened further when the civil servant who was active in the first round was reassigned as the municipality’s ‘program manager for participation’ in order to develop a strategic political role for participation and self-organization. The alderman, program manager and regional manager for Broekpolder looked for renewed interaction with the board of the Federation (co-creation). However, budgetary problems remained. The Federation was still looking for broader connections with private and public organizations to get a public-private-society partnership arranged in which different organizations show commitment (financially or in other ways) to the citizen initiative. 
";2;2;Self-initiated by participants;2;4;Off;3;4;3;3;4;4;Off;Off;3;Highly confident;"The Broekpolder is an old recreational area of approximately 300 hectares in the northwestern part of the city Vlaardingen. In early 2000, the city and the province of South-Holland had plans to build houses in the area. The Broekpolder was designated as a search location for ‘rural living’ by the regional government.  This caused a large protest in the local community, which resulted in ten thousand signatures against the arrival of country houses in the Broekpolder. The regional government decided not to take any initiatives until 2010 in order to realize rural living. 
Meanwhile a few of (politically) active citizens who knew each other quite well of Vlaardingen had gathered, in order to maintain the open and green character of the area. This group of 30 citizens organized at the end of 2002 a number of meetings where citizens were invited to consider the future of the Broekpolder. The civil servant, alderman and leading citizens worked closely to jointly develop a policy note that later evolved into a social contract in which the citizens’ initiative (Federation Broekpolder) and its relationships with the municipality (civil service, Mayor and Alderman, and City Council) were elaborated.
With regard to its representativeness and creating support for ideas and plans, the Federation is focused on creating linkages to municipality (council, administration and civil service) and broad society in Vlaardingen. It has several informal links to key players in the civil service and Mayor and Aldermen. The vision document for the area is developed with the consent of the council and administration. The Federation also realizes to involve the broader public in the development of the vision document and the specific projects it embraces. 
There was a high sense of interdependency, as the local government saw the community initiative as an import asset in developing community support and legitimacy for the area development. The local government also had developed policy notes (political agreement) to enhance public participation and self-reliance in the community of municipality of Vlaardingen. For the citizens, they depended on the financial resources from the local government, their expertise on legal and procedural matters. The community were highly educated so they knew quite well what plans to develop that were feasible. Sometimes civil servants and external experts were involved to increase their knowledge and expertise for developing the area. 
An important change was when a new Alderman came in that was less supportive to the community initiative and the wider collaboration between municipality and community initiative. Budget cuts came and civil servants were halted in joining the collaboration. Also the politicians became more reluctant in getting involved in the collaboration. After the leave of this Alderman, a new came in, and with this fresh political person the collaboration increased again. There was now more political legitimacy and support for the collaboration. Although, the collaboration was not that intense anymore as in the middle of the process. Representative of the community initiative wanted to become less dependent from the municipality and looked for new partners, like the regional government, private actors (banks, investors, philanthropic institutes, health care organizations, etc.). 
                ";1-mei;6-okt;nov-15;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;4;Off;4;3;3;3;Off;2;2;4;4;4;Off;3;Off;Highly confident;" This citizens’ initiative was formalized on October 5, 2006 in the Foundation Federation Broekpolder. The foundation has two goals): 
(a) in the broadest sense development and maintaining of the area Broekpolder through sport, recreation, culture, cultural history, nature and education; 
(b) take care of the common interests of the users of the Broekpolder on a voluntary basis.
Municipality (the administration) and the Federation jointly developed a policy note that was later on developed into a social contract in which the citizens’ initiative and its relationship with the municipality were elaborated. Special attention was paid to the degree and the extent of citizen participation and initiative of the Federation. With respect to participation possibilities a distinction between area maintenance and regional development of Broekpolder was made. With regard to the maintenance activities, the Federation was allowed to give a qualified advice on the contract extension of the Board which is the basis of the performance of daily maintenance in the Broekpolder. The municipal administration can only differ from these advices when she has strong argument for it. However, the Federation should refrain from a direct interference with the normal daily maintenance.
 With regard to the regional development two categories are distinguished: small enhancements and large development projects. With regard to small enhancements, the Federation gives binding advice to the Mayor and Aldermen. With regard to the large development plans and projects, the Federation takes the initiative in generating ideas and subsequently develops in cooperation with the municipality those projects. However there is the precondition that the Federation provides societal support for their ideas and plans: it should make enough effort to bring all the interested parties and stakeholders together that reflects the population of Vlaardingen. The Federation gets a budget for their organization and the maintenance and development of the area. This budget is approved by the council. The Federation is bound by this budget, by the overall structure plan for the region and by legal requirements.
The collaborative forums were quite inclusive for a number of reasons. The leading civil servant made sure that administration and municipal council were involved. The community organization made sure that many and diverse citizens were involved (more than 100 volunteers) and implemented a poll among the all residents of Vlaardingen to show their representative power. During the middle and end of the collaboration period (observed) the municipal council was less involved and reluctant to form a portal (selection of members of the municipal council) as first contact persons from politics to the community organization and the collaboration at large. This hampered the political support and input for the collaboration and the initiative. 
Decision-making on the side of the municipality became less transparent in this way. The decision-making within the collaboration was fine, as there were public-community groups in which decisions were made. Also within the community organization a board of governers joined frequently and discussed issues and made decisions which were communicated to the community at large at various moments. Although, from the municipal side this representative decision-making was often criticized, as one argued that a few decided for many without proper procedures in place. The community organization was less strictly organized and knew less procedures.

The overall leadership was actually done by the chairperson of the community organization. Her leadership style can be characterized as connective, transformative and transactional, with different emphasis during different stages of the collaboration process.
At the beginning the style can be characterized as transformative and transactional. She took the lead in developing a vision for the collaboration and community organization (together with the civil servant from the municipality). She focused on group formation and developing ground rules and structures for the collaboration.
Later the style developed towards connective/boundary spanning leadership as she crossed various domains, organizations and sectors to develop a more collaborative imperative. She involved public, private and societal organizations and actors and managed to durably connect them. She didn't succeed in connecting the municipal council though. The transactional focus was apparent in knowing what the rules and procedures  in the municipality were and was able to connect to these, keeping administration and bureaucracy on board, although this took most of the time, as she indicated herself. ";3;5;4;Off;4;3;2;Off;5;5;5;Off;2;4;4;Off;3;5;4;Off;3;3;5;4;5;Off;Off;4;4;5;5;Off;Highly confident;"The collaborative process is an example of an intense process of interactions. At the beginning much time and effort was paid to get many people with different organizational backgrounds activated, both from the municipal and community side. The actor group was small at first, starting with a few concerned and dissatisfied citizens. But this steadily grew. Many volunteers, over 100, became involved; the municipal organization with various actors (alderman, project leader, contact person civil servant, neighborhood manager, etc) became involved as well. Certainly at the beginning of the process, municipal council was also involved. However, at the alderman level and political level involvement became less apparent, especially the political municipal council as they were afraid to commit themselves to soon to the process and results from the collaboration. The alderman also dropped out after elections and was replaced twice, first by a reluctant person and then by a more alderman with a more supportive attitude. Especially with municipal council the interaction was sometimes fierce and full of conflict; the collaboration with civil servants was steady though. 
In the collaboration joint forms of cooperation and coordination was agreed upon (see before). The intended type of outcomes was agreed upon soon in the process. The results in terms of area development (leisure, education, water infrastructure, landscape, etc.) was supported by all involved stakeholders. The process was very much focused at bringing many/all relevant interest on board and make decisions based on consensus or compromise. Together information was gathered to find out about issues and problems in the area and to get to joined solutions. 
The collaboration was strategically as well, focusing on the character and experience with the collaboration. The Federation changed focus from municipal organization as their attention dropped in the middle of the process, leading to focus on involving other public, private and societal organizations in the collaboration, making the Federation less dependent form the municipality of Vlaardingen. ";4;4;3;Off;2;3;3;Off;2;4;3;Off;4;2;2;2;1;1;Off;Off;2;2;2;Off;2;5;3;Off;1;4;2;2;1;1;2;2;2;2;2;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Highly confident;"At the beginning the collaboration got a lot of attention by the municipal council. They approved the governance structure, the ground rules and procedures that were formulated in the 'social contract' between Federation and municipality. 
During the process the council also requested that the Federation/collaboration implemented a poll among the wider community/residents of Vlaardingen city, to see whether the plans and the first results from the collaboration met their wishes and got get their support. This kind of monitoring is more at a distance, compared to the beginning were the council was more in the front seat to safeguard the democratic process of the collaboration. This political attention and monitoring changed quite rapidly during the process, due to a changing political climate in which the local political parties gained seats and were less positive and supportive to the collaboration and the community organization in general. 
At the end attention grew again, but a good monitoring system safeguarding accountability at the side of the municipal organization was never active again.
An official accountability check by external parties or even internally in the collaboration or the community organization never officially occurred. There were more informal checks and balances, on informal bases between leading actors in the organization and collaboration, which functioned well as never any issues of integrity and good governance were discussed/issued.

This covenant/social contract took also care of which types of participation was there in the collaboration, ranging from advice, decision-making to implementation (with budget). An innovative governance/collaboration model was designed as output of the first stage.
In the second stage the content of the area development came to the fore. A vision document was developed by the municipal council to show the boundaries/framework in which the content could be developed by the collaboration. 
In the third stage (2009-March 2010), the Federation had the task of developing a formal plan - the Integral Area Development and Maintenance Plan - to (re)develop and maintain the area. The Plan was prepared and developed by prioritizing a few projects: The development of a core nature area, archaeological education center, activity forest, and small harbor. In this round, the citizen initiative was discussed a couple of times in the city council. 

Ultimately the previous political plans to develop the Broekpolder area into 'rural living area' was canceled, and this was the prime goal of the community initiative. The area got a multi-fuctional orientation as displayed in the Area Development and Maintenance Plan, and discussed shortly above. The area became lively again and is used by residents, visitors, tourists, students, etc. The problem got solved that the area was revitalized again.

There is also broad support and legitimacy for the plan/outcome. Residents are happy, the municipal organization but also involved stakeholders (sports clubs, leisure organizations, etc.) are very happy with the way the area got transformed. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Moreover, they found that they did not have the insights they and their administrators needed to develop an informed and high quality policy solutions in a number og policy areas. Therefore, they decided to restructure the political system and introduce a new type of ad hoc committees, which today goes under the name 'The Gentofte Model'. Each committee address a pressing policy problem that the Municipal Council decide need special political attention, and is composed of five politiicans from different parties and 10 relevant and affected citizens. The committees are commissioned to develop a policy proposal through a collaborative governance process, within a given time frame. The timeframe vary according to the task. As such, the primary political motivation for ntroducing the Gentofte Model was to improve the knowledge base of the elected councillors and to strengthen their dialogue with local citizens and stakeholders and involve citizens in policy making (City Council 2015). This objective was to be achieved without increasing the amount of time that the politicians spend in tending their job as councillors. Except for the mayors local councillors are lay people with limited time to spend because they in most cases have a job to tend. 
 
On of the first ad hoc committees was dedicated to developing a new youth policy. The case study reported, builds on data collected over the 10 month long collaborative governance process between five politicians and ten young people resulting leading to the development of a new innovative youth policy. The politicians decided to initiate a collaborative governance process because they felt out of touch with the problems and concerns of young people and wanted to initiate a closer dialogue with them to get the input needed to formulate a qualified policy. They  wanted to get a better understanding of problems that young people struggle with, and to harvest the ideas about how the muniticpality can contribute to alleviating these problems and improve the lives of young people. The aimed-for output was a policy proposal to be debated in the municipal council. 
 
As mandated, the Committee ended up producing a policy proposal within the assigned 10 month timeframe. The work progressed as planned over seven ordinary meetings. The members decided to host a youth camp in order to debate a draft version of the policy with a larger group of young people. The committee also decided to form a number of work groups that w with experts and relevant stakeholders. Each workgroup was assigned to produce certain deliverables in terms of specialized knowledge about a specific topic relevant to the discussions in the Committee. The collaboration process ended with the Municipality Council endorsing the policy without changes. 
 
Over time, as the work in the Committee progressed, ambitions grew among some of the young Committee members. They wanted to initiate concrete activities, and expressed aspirations regarding participating in the dissemination and implementation phase that would start when the policy had been endorsed by the politicians. To meet this request, two of the most eager members were enrolled in disseminating the policy to young people in the local community.    ";1;3;Externally directed by law or authority;2;3;Off;2;3;4;4;3;4;Off;Off;5;Highly confident;"The historical background is that young people and municipal politicians rarely communicate. As such, there was very little prehistory to rely on. The politiicans had very vague ideas about what to expect from the youth and were highly uncertain about how to communicate with them. The chair of the youth committee note that he feared that the politicians would bore the young people to death, or would talk to much and thereby fail to get the youth to talk. Some of the young people explain that they had no prior idea about what a municipality was and what to expect from politician. They were astounded to find that both the public administrators that facilitated the meetings and the participating politicians were nice people who were genuinly interested in what they had to say. The youth were also surpriced that politics was actually very interesting. 
 
The collaboration was initiated by the municipal council who invited 10 carefully selected young people with different backgrounds to become members of the committee. The 10 youth were then invited to a premeeting where the chair of the committee and a young public administrator - a boundary spanner - introduced them to the legal rules and regulations around the work in the committee and the general purpose of the youth committee. At the first ordinary meeting, the 15 participants presented themselves to each other. They each brought an object that mattered to them and told something about who they were. The public administration had prepared a quizz that gave the participants basic information of hard facts related to smoking habits, religious background, education, health, employment etc. among young peopl. Then they formed groups that discussed carefully prepared profiles of young people with different challenges. The meeting concluded with a listing of issues that the members of the committtee wanted to discuss at the comming meetings. The observation of the meeting documented that the collaboration got off to a strong start despite the fact that there was no prehistory of collaboration.
 
The sense of interdependence was strongest among the politicans, who had a clear sense that they would be unabe to develop a relevant youth policy on their own but the young people had clearly no indication of what they could get out of collaborating with the politicians and the staff at the city hall. They were mostly currious and honoured to have been invited. 
 
As the collaboration progressed the sense of interdependence grew among both parties. The politicans were further reassured that they could not have developed a relevant policy on their own. They found that they received important insights that they did not have before. Moreover, the politiicans realized that some of the youth could play a key role in mobilizing other youth to take part in different municipal projects. The young people on their side experienced that the politicians really listened to them and that their point of view was taken seriously. They also felt that they had a strong influence on the policy output. Their main concern was whether the policy would actually end up being implemented. 
 
The main problem for the collaboration was to keep up the momentum and motivation among all the young people throughout the process. Some of them stopped attending the meetings, and the survey show that they found the meetings long. However, it was not mainly the most vulnerable youth that droped out. The drop outs were equally distributed among youth with different backgrounds.

The mission statement mandated the ad hoc youth committee to formulate a proposal for a youth policy within 10 months.  The policy was to be formulated in general terms rather than a listing of concrete initiatives to be carried out. Moreover, the statement provided an elaborate set of inclusion critieria in terms of meticulously described profiles of the 10 youth that was to be selected. The criteria aimed to ensure variation in terms of educational background, age, employment, nationality and gender. The concrete young people who fitted these profiles were apponited by the political parties in turn following what is known as the Donish method.  It was agreed among the partied to select youth that were not politically active and associated with a particular party, because the general idea was to get input from ordinary citizens. The politicians were also selected through the Donish method to secure poportionality with seats in the municipal council.   

The ground ruled layed out in the mission statement also emphasized that the committee had the autonomy to deside how it would work. The mission statement suggested four meetings and proposed that the committee cound form work groups with external experts and host other events. The youth committee exploited this autonomy to extend the number of meetings to seven. Moreover, it decided to host a 24 hour youth camp in order to secure further inclusion. They also invited different guests to the meetings who would give their perspective on the situation of young people in Gentofte. The guests included different experts and other actors with specific insights. Finally they formed five workgroups along the way that were composed of external experts and public administrators. Each of work groups were asked to prepare a specific input that would inform the discussions in the committee. The chair of the committee and the public adminstrators proposed most of these extra activities to the committee, whcih were then accepted by the rest of the members.

Another politician was appointed co-chair. The chairs planned the meetings in close collaboration with the public administration. A young public administrator was appointed to be in close dialogue with the young members of the Committee between meetings as well as to assist in planning the meetings. The leadership stype was explicitely facilitative and consisted of innovative and creative endeavours to make the young people feel comfortable, and to give them information about the topic without boring them. Moreover, all meetings were varied in form consisting of a combination of group work, small exercises that activated the members, and short inputs from experts. The politicians in the Committee were careful not to speak to much. They were eager to listen and make the young people talk and some of the young people even felt that the politicians were too quiet. As time progressed, however, and the Committee was formulating the policy proposal, the politicians became more active and good discussions took place where everybody were engaged and spoke their mind and did so in a positive climate. The politicians, who came from different parties also managed to keep party disagreements out of the debates, although that might have kept some of the hard issues under the radar, that could have stimulated debate. 
 
The public administrators played a spefic role in the leadership. In the first phase, they mainly prepared and facilitated the meetings. They also stayed in ongoing contact with the young people between meetings in order to ensure that they would attend the meetings and felt wellcome. In the final stages of the collaboration, the public administrators became more focussed on ensuring that the Committee was ready to deliver a policy proposal within the assigned timeframe, and they took on the job of preparing a document that was revised by the Committee members at the two final meetings. In other words, the focus of attention in the leadership gradually changed from process facilitation to product delivery.

Moreover, for the most part, the collaboration took place at the City Hall in surroundings where the politicians felt at home but were foreign to the young people. In order to overcome this initial bias and barrier and initiate a good dialogue going, the leadership consisting of two politicans and three public administrators, decided to use different artefacts and methods that felt familiar to the young people. Different games were used, and posters, pictures and quizzes were brought into use. Much of the debates took place in small groups. This helped greatly to get the conversation going and the young people took from an early stage active part in the conversation. The politicians highly appreciated the facilitative efforts made by the administrators, but also felt that the process was close to overfacilitated. The politicians were careful not to say too much, which is generally hard for politicians and reduced the benefit they got from the collaboration. When the politicans were visiting the youth camp held halfway into the collaboration process, they held a premeeting among themselves where they discussed what role they whould have in the camp: they decided that they should mainly listen in order not to dominate. The young people appreciated the politicians' willingness to listen but felt that the politicans did not speak their mind, which hampered the dialogue and created some uncertainty. ""We do not know what they think"" one said in an interview.
 
The communication became more interactive over time, however, as the participants became acquainted with each other and got actively engaged in preparing the policy proposal. The main learning from the process is that it is difficult for politicians to define their role in collaboration with other actors, and particularly with young people, and that tehy tend to avoid the hard political questions, which is taken up  in the political back chambers where only politiicans participate.   ";3;4;5;Off;3;3;3;Off;2;2;2;Off;4;4;5;2;2;2;Off;Off;2;2;2;Off;2;3;3;Off;2;5;5;5;2;2;1;1;1;4;4;4;Off;Off;Off;Off;Highly confident;Throughout the process the leadership and the administration held a keen eye on the formal goals for the collaborative process, and constantly reminded the participants of these goals. Relevant Standing Committees in the Municipal Council had oversight with the process, and received regular updates of the work. We asked the politicians in the Committee if they informed their party groups but few of them did. The latter did create some discontent among politicians who were not members of the Committee, and some of the parties began to organize reporting sessions from the different Committees. Minutes from all meetings were accessible to all politicians at a digital portal. The local media as well as the national radio reported from the youth camp. The final policy proposal was presented at a closed meeting in the Municipal Council. After being endorsed by the Municipal Council, the policy was communicated to the public in the media and two of the youth members were hired to dessiminate the policy to different groups of young people.   ;5;5;5;Off;1;1;1;Off;2;3;3;Off;1;1;1;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;3;4;5;5;5;1;1;1;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;3;3;4;4;4;4;4;4;Off;Off;Off;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;1;Off;1;1;Off;Off;;4;4;4;5;5;5;3;4;4;3;4;4;Off;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Highly confident;"As commissioned by the Municipal Council, a policy proposal was produced. It was innovative in the sense that it offered a new and nouranced understanding of the policy problem. It did not, however, provide new innovative ideas and guidance regarding how to improve the situation for young people in Gentofte. This can partly be explained by the fact that the Committee was not commissioned to point to concrete initiatives and solutions, and partly because more operational suggestions would probably raise political disagreements. 
 
The generality of the policy proposal and the few concrete opperational suggestions meant that it was uncontroversial for the municipality council to endorse it, but it was equally difficult to ensure that it would get any concrete impact. Thus, it is difficult to determine how much impact it  actually had on the operational level, but there is a general awareness among politicans and public administrators of the need to involve and engage young people actively in decisions that affect their lives. A concrete example of a policy innovation indirectly resulting from the collaboration is the purchase of a specially designed bus that young people can hire and use for street concerts etc.   
 
As an important side effect of the collaboration, noted by both politicans, young people and public administrators, is a stengthening of the mutual understanding and level of trust between the involved parties. The politicians have achieved a much better understanding of what it means to be a young person ion Gentofte, and the youth have a much more positive impression of the municipality and the politiicans, and a better understaning of the importance and difficulties associated with policy making. Of the seven youth that participated in all the meetings and stayed on to the end, most of them state that they would be ready to participate in a similar process if they were invited again.

Thirty percent of its territory are environmentally protected areas; its HDI was 0.847 in 2019(UNDP, 2020).  The city imports 65 percent of the water from neighbor cities, energy is generated outside the city, most of the food comes from the metropolitan area in the mainland, outside the city´s territory and 90 percent of the waste is taken by the city´s waste management autarchy (COMCAP) to Biguaçu landfill, 25 miles away, by truck (PMF, 2021). 
          Florianópolis has high levels of inequality and many poverty-stricken areas where the lack of access to basic public services aggravates the residents’ vulnerable conditions. In 2018, it was estimated that 16 percent of the population lived in subnormal housing, most of which in the city’s 64 favelas (shanty towns), totaling approximately 51,000 people. In 2008, as the Chico Mendes favela in Monte Cristo´s cluster expanded, it faced inadequate organic waste disposal and limited availability of municipal collection services, which led to critical public health problems. Following the death of two residents due to leptospirosis transmitted by rats, a local movement mobilized efforts to address the waste issue. Together with the Municipal Community Health Center and the help of an ecological and community agriculture NGO (CEPAGRO), residents organized a system to segregate and collect their organic waste and transform it into fertilizer for use in local food and medicinal plants production (De Abreu, 2013). The main purpose was to reduce infectious diseases and malnutrition, but also to foster agroecological practices. Their objectives were to provide the community with a clean environment, healthy, locally produced food, as well as work opportunities for the youth and elderly. There were no quantifiable outputs or outcomes planned in the beginning.
          Through the reduction of organic waste in open spaces and homes, the pests gradually disappeared from the community, the levels of disease decreased and there were no further cases of deaths from leptospirosis. Households began participating in the segregation of domestic waste and exchanging their organic waste for fertilizer with COMCAP. The initiative was called Bucket Revolution Program (PRB) due to the original method for collecting domestic organic waste in buckets. It continued beyond different administrations, benefitting 200 families and recycling 5.6 tons/month of organic waste between 2009 and 2012 (Peixoto, 2019; De Abreu, 2013). It has since expanded and inspired many other similar initiatives, both in Florianópolis and in other Brazilian cities. Municipal government established the Municipal Urban Agriculture Policy by decree in 2017 and in July 2020 the city launched the Zero Waste 2030 program.
         Besides the composting methodology developed by CEPAGRO and implemented by volunteer residents, the engagement of community members with several other stakeholders, including the municipality, was key to the initiative’s success. Despite some technical and financial limitations, the BRP became a model of community waste management and sociotechnical innovation, garnering national and international recognition and support. The PRB is coordinated by community members who are now requesting to be compensated by the city for the diverted waste from the landfill as a result of their work. Official figures estimates that 3% of the waste have been diverted between 2014 (initial measuring date) and 09/2020.
 ";3;5;Independently convened by a third party;1;3;Off;4;4;2;4;4;4;Off;Off;4;Highly confident;"Santa Catarina state (SC) and its capital Florianópolis have a longstanding relationship with agriculture and agroecology.  Migratory waves from rural regions settled in peri-urban areas, mainly in Florianópolis. Many migrants driven by economic crises had worked in farms or owned small properties, bringing their knowledge and culture to the cities. Several initiatives in SC engage this population or their descendants, promoting agroecology, family farming and permaculture since the beginning of the 2000s and more recently, urban agriculture (UA). For instance, Florianópolis has been implementing school garden programs since 2001. Later, led by activists, UA became a catalyst for social movements fighting food insecurity and poverty, human rights and land tenure issues.  The Center for the Study and Promotion of Community Agriculture (CEPAGRO), founded in April 1990 by small farmers and technicians, is a leading NGO that spearheaded several important initiatives, including the Bucket Revolution that sparked Florianópolis’ Urban Agriculture policy.
      The connection between community food gardens and health can be traced to 2001 and even before that, through uncoordinated initiatives in municipal schools and health centers. Fighting dengue fever was an important driver to promote clean-ups in poor areas with inadequate sanitation services. The institutional and legal framework for urban agriculture and agroecology is a key enabler of initiatives such as the PRB, including the federal and state spheres of government. Along with other relevant legislation, the National School Feeding Program (PNAE law 11947/2009), fostered UA actions at municipal level.
     CEPAGRO was the leading agent in establishing the PRB´s organic waste collection activities in 2009, including capacity building and fundraising. One of the main leaders of the agroecology movement in Brazil was trained in one of CEPAGRO´s capacity building programs. He later joined their team and in 2016 was elected city councilor, now in his second term. Other key stakeholders include Rede Semear, municipal departments of health, education and environment, the federal university, and relevant SC state government departments. Rede Semear is a network founded on 08 August 2015, as an independent, intersectoral, multidisciplinary group, formed by members and civil society institutions with the participation of public servants, whose objective is to strengthen urban agriculture in Florianópolis.
   The Monte Cristo communities managed to self-organize, receiving prizes and funding from several sources. They expanded their activities and have a community kitchen, a food market and implement other self-managed initiatives. They are also supported by the municipality, along with over 150 community gardens throughout the city.  Despite different administrations, municipal programs continued and were strengthened since 2001, improving services and collaborating with civil society players.   
    Despite different administrations, municipal programs continued and were strengthened since 2001, improving services and collaborating with civil society players. However, the municipality gradually took on a leading role through the public works and waste management municipal company, COMCAP. IN 2018, the city joined the Waste Zero campaign committing to significant waste reduction until 2030, by promoting recycling and composting. While the poorer communities relied on municipal public services, such as health care, education and waste collection, the NGOs continued engaged in promoting UA, and providing training and technical assistance.";6-okt;6-okt;20+;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;4;Off;5;5;4;4;Off;5;5;5;5;4;Off;4;Off;Mostly confident;"The collaboration between the several stakeholders from civil society and government institutions was not purposefully designed as a single initiative. It was an organically constructed web with several nodes, developed at different levels and in different timelines. Each node had its own rules, but this polycentric governance arrangement was based on transparency, shared decision-making and mutual support, according to several interviewees from the municipality, particularly in the earlier period. As the city leadership grew, the structure became more formalized and hierarchical.  Within the communities, for instance, leadership roles were assigned by vote or assumed by volunteers; the NGOs and other networks gathered in meetings to establish rules for their own and for joint governance.  CEPAGRO actively sought to support the civil society movements and provided training and funding, coordinated partnerships with the university and businesses interested in supporting their initiatives.

At the city level, senior managers were allowed a relatively flexible arrangement, where coordinators and managers in the departments had autonomy to work directly with the community members. In the second period, however, when the 2017 decree established the Municipal Program on Urban Agriculture (PMAU), the focus on waste management and composting increased, with a predominant concern about efficiency. A structure that had been so far horizontalized, and fostered by a bottom-up demand, gradually shifted to a more top-down approach. City´s actions became determined in the regulation that followed the Decree. However, some interviewees noted that the PMAU is not a law and as a decree is more vulnerable to political agendas. Nevertheless, some judicial safeguards are provided by the Decrees.

The collaboration is multilevel and polycentric, with several forms and styles of leadership in the different nodes along the three phases of the period considered in this assessment. 
An analytical approach to better understand the network of collaboration should look at the different elements of the system, where composting and urban agriculture take place in the intersection of agroecological practices and urban solid waste management. Furthermore, players with multiple identities have different roles in the collaboration system, some with leadership in different contexts. 

Community members leadership was key in building trust amongst participants and fostering engagement of residents in the organic waste collection and composting.  Trainers from civil society and municipal staff also have leadership roles vis-à-vis the communities, contributing with knowledge and financial resources brokerage. Politicians and senior managers with authority and decision-making power determine rules and regulations, impacting the whole system.

Despite some inherent tensions between key players, particularly from civil society organizations and political leaders (politicians and senior managers), shared goals such as improving sanitation, nutrition and health in the communities, albeit with different priorities, contribute to the collaboration between parties. For instance, there is a strong push from the community members, NGOs and activists toward the acknowledgement of the participants’ financial contribution in the composting scheme through compensation from the city; their focus is on the social aspects. Municipal technical and middle management officials are engaged in implementing the strategies developed collaboratively until the second phase, whereas political and senior management leadership focus on economic aspects, as well as political gains.

As the composting scheme expanded, with increasing demand from other communities and pressure on the municipal managers in charge of implementing the urban agriculture initiatives, the city needed to respond with more efficient services and financial resources. The political agenda impacted the UA policy implementation when leadership changed the administrative and governance structures when the mayor was reelected for a second term, effective January 2020 to 2024. The PMAU implementation was further impacted by the pandemic throughout the year.

Individuals and institutions from academia, the private sector and other levels of government participated in supporting roles, convened by the leading players. Being a multilevel and polycentric system, accountability is also decentralized. The organizations that managed project funding were accountable to both the communities and the funders, submitting reports and publishing results in the media.

The collaboration resulted in several community gardens being implemented in Florianópolis´ underprivileged neighborhoods, mostly in facilities on public land provided by the municipality. By early 2020 there were 112 community garden sites managed and operated jointly by community members and municipal managers from the health and education secretariats. Senior managers report the increasing interest in training opportunities provided by the city, such as a home vermicomposting project launched in 2017, called “Minhoca na Cabeça” (roughly equivalent to “crazy about worms”). There has also been a growing demand for medicinal plants from the community health centers. Officials report that cases of waterborne diseases have decreased, the community sites are much cleaner, residents use and respect the equipment for organic waste collection available in the streets. Some communities use the fertilizers for their own crops and sell the surplus. 

On the other hand, the municipality expanded its waste collection infrastructure and composting scheme, committing to ambitious goals toward waste reduction by 2030. Besides collecting food scraps from households, the municipality provides curbside collection of yard pruning according to a bimonthly schedule in some areas of the city.

In terms of collective outputs and social outcomes over time, there was an increase in the demand for UA sites and technical support by neighborhood associations. The PRB became an association that is self-managed and sustained, although it struggles with funding issues after 2012. Its main demand is for compensation from the city, due to the savings in waste management they have provided from their composting activities. And while the concern for health and nutrition has spread beyond poor areas to middle-class neighborhoods, there are several communities that use the urban agriculture and agroecology platform as leverage to further a political agenda of social issues such as inequality, exclusion, land tenure policies, poverty and discrimination.

The idea behind Spitex networks is that patients should be treated as much as possible by specially trained nurses, social workers and doctors outside the hospital and in a familiar setting (their home), so as to increase their comfort, autonomy and self-determination.
Since Spitex networks are mandated, as better explained later, clear objectives can be found in their public duties and performance agreements. These documents state that (1), patients should be treated as long as medically possible for everything that they need in their own household environment and (2), costs should be contained because the most of the resources of Spitex networks come from public funding. In this perspective, the Spitex aims can be grouped into three categories: (1) serving as many patients as possible, (2) with as many services as possible (3) and at the lowest possible cost to the community. 
";6;6;Externally directed by law or authority;Off;Off;Yes;3;3;Off;3;4;4;Off;Off;4;Reasonably confident;At the beginning of 2000, the Swiss Federal Government (and subsequently, the Swiss Cantonal Governments) issued some laws to invite municipalities to collaborate in order to jointly organize the provision of health and social care services for people in their homes. As a result, Swiss municipalities set up specific organizations in the form of consortia and foundations. These organizations provide some services themselves and activate other non-profit organizations (such as the Swiss Red Cross, collaborating nursing homes and collaborating specialized physicians) to provide ancillary services like transportation of disabled clients, meal services for those unable to cook, night care, oncological care and psychological support. In this way public networks were set up all across the Switzerland, including the canton, the municipalities, the established organization as central core agency (i.e., as an administrative and professional entity managing the network and providing the majority of the services) and other non-profit organizations providing complementary services, each of which has its own competences and specializations. More specifically, usually medical doctors contact the Spitex central organization and require assistance for their patients. A Spitex commission evaluate the request and define a specific package of homecare services for each client. If the Spitex organization is not able to provide all the services, some no-profit organizations are contacted and activated.;20+;20+;20+;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;Off;5;4;4;4;Off;4;4;4;4;4;Off;4;Off;Reasonably confident;"The Spitex network exhibits integration, coordination and control mechanisms. All these mechanisms are formally known and implemented by all the network partners, even if network partners do not seem to rely on them a great deal. Informal contacts and personal relationships between people involved in the partner organizations seem to be a more powerful mechanism to sustain and promote partner interaction.
The partner coordination is supported by formalized mechanisms such as regular meetings involving all the network partners, even if those mechanisms do not seem to govern decision-making. As reported in Cristofoli et al. (2015: 506): “the relationships between the network partners are not supported by any formalized contracts: “There are no formal agreements. The collaboration is based on a very spontaneous approach,” said the Director of one of the partner organizations, who added that “people do not contact each other because of written rules but due to their personal relationships”.

First, the Spitex Director shows the ability to act as facilitator, thus fixing and changing operating rules to ensure the network functioning. As reported in Cristofoli et al. (2015: 508): “when faced with difficulties in implementing local commissions, which were expected to monitor the needs of patients living in different geographical areas, the Spitex Directors relied on informal relationships with individuals working in the areas in question: “Originally we implemented the local commissions, as required by law, but they didn’t work very well, so in order to be able to satisfy our patients’ needs we preferred to rely on trustworthy people working in these areas.” 
Secondly, the Spitex Director shows the ability to act a mediator, by resolving conflicts among network partners. As reported in Cristofoli et al. (2015: 508-509) , for example, in ""the case of tensions caused by personnel dismissals, the Spitex Directors organized meetings with staff members to ease tensions"", or ""when one representative of Municipalities was dissatisfied with the Spitex services, the Directors supported the Spitex workers and organized meetings to find a joint solution"". 
Thirdly, the Spitex Director acts as network leader: he develops strategies and action, engages partners in participative decision-making, activates the whole network, builds commitment on critical changes, ecc, but what is more important is that he enjoys the trust and consensus of all network members. This allows him to act outside the expected channels, if necessary, to ensure the network functioning and satisfy the citizens needs.

It is a system of mobility governance and management introduced in January 2012 in the form of a structural measure, which aims to discourage the use of private vehicles in favour of public transport. Area C regulates motor vehicles’ access to the central Limited Traffic Zone of Milan through a road pricing system, based on automatic recognition of vehicles through cameras.

Area C aims at reducing congestion and pollution, and more generally improving citizens’ quality of life and movement within the city. As stated by the Municipality itself, the main purpose of Area C is to improve the living conditions of those who live, work, study in and visit the city. More specifically, its objectives are:
- decreasing road traffic within the city centre;
- improving public transport networks;
- raising funds for soft mobility infrastructures, such as cycle lanes, pedestrian zones, 30kph zones;
- improving quality of life by reducing the number of accidents, uncontrolled parking, noise and air pollution.

This initiative also generates substantial revenues for the Municipality, which are then used to support other sustainable mobility initiatives. Compared to other similar road pricing initiatives in Europe, the innovative dimension in the case of Area C concerns two main aspects. Firstly, the system allows a high degree of flexibility and customisation from the viewpoint of the user (with a dedicated website called ‘MyAreaC’), but also from the viewpoint of the internal functioning of the system itself. Secondly, the system was designed through a structured participatory process, where meetings and public events were promoted by the municipal administration so as to define goals and strategies that were shared by citizens, business associations, environmental groups, civic associations and the local and regional institutions that are most directly affected by the measure.

Area C has been highly successful in reducing congestion and improving legitimacy and acceptance among citizens (which favoured the subsequent development of a wider, though less restrictive, Area B, which entered into force on February 25, 2019). 
";5;4;Self-initiated by participants;2;2;Off;5;5;2;5;1;1;Off;Off;1;Mostly confident;"Area C  is the result of the evolution of a previous scheme, called Ecopass, which was introduced in 2008 as a pollution charge to be paid by vehicles entering Milan’s city centre. In its first year, Ecopass succeeded in reducing congestion and car emissions, due to traffic reduction as well as substitution of older polluting vehicles with new cleaner ones, but the effect on congestion progressively decreased because of car substitution. Since the administration was reluctant to change the system towards a more restrictive one, a group of citizens promoted a referendum (held in June 2011) that tested citizens’ attitude towards a charge to be paid by all vehicles: the result was clearly in favour of the change. As a result, the Ecopass pollution charge was replaced by the Area C congestion charge in the same central area of Milan, characterized by a flat charge of €5, with the new system entering into force in January 2012. 

While Area C took advantage of the existing infrastructure, the rationale and the operating system were to change considerably relative to the previous Ecopass. The new system was established through a very intense and rapid planning phase – four months overall, which was then followed by implementation and progressive evolution. The leading role was played as expected by the Municipality, and particularly by the Central Directorate for Mobility, Transport, Energy and Environment, with an important role also played by the Office of Communication. During the design phase, four cross-departmental working groups were created, so as to share relevant knowledge and needs to be taken into consideration; these working groups were covering the following areas respectively: Road signs, Information systems, Legal, and Communication. Two additional key public organizations were involved both in the planning and implementation phase: AMAT and ATM. AMAT is the Agenzia Mobilità Ambiente e Territorio (Agency for Mobility, Environment and Land), owned the Municipality and which provided critical technical support from the design stage to implementation. Azienda Trasporti Milanesi (ATM – Milanese Public Transports) is a public company, responsible for the management of public transports within the city and a few surrounding municipalities, and for a number of additional services including the BikeMi bike-sharing; it is also in charge of Area C management from a technological viewpoint. The Area C project, then, was designed and implemented by a partnership of three separate organizations: AMAT, ATM, and the Municipality of the Milan with its relevant internal Departments, with a leading and coordinating role played by the latter. The whole initiative however, was far from a top-down process imposed on the citizens. The Municipality took particular care in involving citizens and other stakeholders throughout, based on the belief that such involvement would benefit the Administration’s reputation and, most critically, the success of the project itself. The Municipality organized nine workshops with representatives of categories who were likely to be affected by Area C in specific ways, including residents of Milan’s central area, owners of garages located within Area C (who were likely to experience a reduction in business), business associations whose associates needed to enter the Area C for goods’ delivery, other public organizations located outside Area C (whose duty vehicles might need to enter the area and could expect to be exempted from the charge because of their public nature) and so on. ";1-mei;nov-15;nov-15;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;3;Off;3;5;5;5;Off;4;3;4;3;4;Off;3;Off;Mostly confident;The proper design phase lasted approximately four months during the second half of the year 2011. No individual project manager was formally put in charge of the project. An informal role of ‘chief coordinator’ was played by the Director of the Municipality’s Central Directorate for Mobility, Transport, Energy and the Environment with, however, considerable autonomy and decision-making/operational power given to key individuals within the different collaborating organizations, including the Municipality itself, AMAT, and ATM. High level Municipality officials would often delegate even important tasks, such as meetings with external stakeholders, to lower level officials, while at the same time empowering them. A certain role was also played by some individuals who had previously worked within the Ecopass team, who provided information about the functioning of the previous system, though the change to a centre-left Administration implied that a certain measure of change was also put in place, with new people working across a more horizontal organization. Engineers within AMAT worked within internal teams and in cooperation with experts at Cornell University and University of Southern California Los Angeles to produce accurate scientific and technical knowledge to support the operational and political implementation of Area C. ATM adapted the pre-existing technological infrastructure so as to allow a different pricing system. The Municipality’s Communication Office also played a very delicate role, as the legitimacy and the positive effects of Area C had to be made clear to citizens and to the stakeholders who were most affected by the new system. Basic rules were set at the outset especially in terms of tariffs, working hours, exemptions and derogations – although a comprehensive system of exemptions and derogations was built along the way. The needs - both legitimate and not - of several categories of stakeholders became clear only once the overall system was put in place, with the consequence that each subsequent request for exemption (such as those for citizens directed at ERs within Area C) had to be subject to a formalised evaluation process, so as to be received into Area C’s system of rules, or rejected. This evaluation of exemption requests was done at the beginning on a case by case basis, to be later institutionalised as a formal process following a learning process.  The four purposefully built working groups internal to the Municipality would meet weekly also with people from ATM and AMAT to check progress: these were especially operational and technical meetings, aimed at bringing the project plan forward. Other meetings were more ‘political’ in nature and were held by Municipal or AMAT employees with various types of stakeholders following a political input. These meetings were with citizens - especially those living in the most affected central Zone 1 of the city - public sector organizations, retailers, the police, etc. The urgency of the first months had implied that, at its launch, Area C was still far from being the advanced and complex system which has later become. Once it was set in motion, a new type of knowledge started to emerge from various sources: that arising from Area C’s day to day workings, from the need to address unforeseen problems or enquiries as well as protests by citizens who had begun to use the system. ;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;5;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;4;Off;4;4;Mostly confident;"The analysis of Area C endorses recent contributions that identify the types of leaders who are most likely to create public value through collaborative innovation (Ansell & Gash, 2012; Sørensen & Torfing 2012; Crosby et al. 2016). This case exemplifies the fact that “leadership roles may be exercised simultaneously, in different combinations or successively. …. While the leadership roles, occasionally, may be carried out by one and the same actor, they tend to be enacted by different actors with different kinds of authority and special experiences, skills and competences.” (Crosby et al. 2016, p. 7). 
The role of the sponsor noted by the literature can be seen clearly in the case of Area C in the person of the Alderman in charge of Mobility. There was a strong political support also more generally by the new Mayor, but this young and charismatic Alderman proved to be daring and willing to risk his own reputation, which also fed motivation and commitment at all levels within the Municipality and outside. The newly appointed Director of the Department for Mobility and Public Transports Planning and Programming acted as a champion but also as implementer: he had already been Director of the lower level Division for Mobility and Public Transport, with the implication that he was already familiar with the organization and the people who would get involved in the planning and implementation of Area C. This facilitated the widespread delegation, autonomy and trust which also played a critical role to ensure speed and effectiveness when needed. Within a large public organization such as the Municipality of Milan, the propensity to innovate as it relates to both individual and organizational capabilities can be – and is – very diverse: a lot depends on Departments’ Directors and their willingness to take risks. 
A critical role as catalyst and champion was played by the Chief of the Division in Charge of Area C, who had been involved in the project since its very beginning and had a deep knowledge of the resources and personnel involved over time, some of whom are actually ATM employees ‘on loan’ to the Municipality in relation to Area C. She has a clear picture of the overall project and is able to tap into the right resources at the right time. By her own admission, she feels some disruption might happen in case she were to leave her position, due to the high level of trust and acknowledgement of leadership that she enjoys by her team.

Additional outcomes include: an increased ability to work across sectoral boundaries, and for public sector officials to work with ctizens; increased trust by citizens towards politicians and public administrators, at least in this specific area of sustainable mobility where expectations were high; high revenues from congestion charges used to fund other sustainable mobility policies.

The WFD, issued in 2003, demands that ambitious ecological goals were met by 2015 (with possible extensions up to 2027). To this end, river basin management plans (RBMP) had to be formulated by 2009 (and then in six-year cycles), involving citizens and organised stakeholders. The German state of Lower Saxony decided to establish 28 area cooperations on the level of smaller river catchments to meet the procedural demands of the WFD, one of them being the Hase catchment area cooperation. The Hase area, a sub-basin of the river Ems, is characterized by agriculture and intensive livestock farming. Excess production of liquid manure has resulted in high pressure on ground and surface water due to high nitrate concentrations. Howerver, intensive agriculture has come to be a part of the region’s identity and is reflected by the interests and perceptions of many actors involved in the implementation process of the WFD.

(b) Area cooperations aimed to foster dialog among administrators, water management stakeholders and the public in developing plans to achieve water quality standards. The rationale behind this, as stated in a 2005 ministerial decree, was that these deliberative bodies would develop innovative proposals and bring new perspectives into river basin management planning. The bodies were given a timeline to develop monitoring programs by 2006, create management objectives and recommend waterbodies for listing as “heavily modified” (and therefore subject to less stringent regulations) by 2007, and develop a program of measures (actions to take) by 2008. The area cooperations were ultimately supposed to provide input for the RBMP and Programs of Measures (PoM) to be reported to the European Commission by December 2009. Participants in the Hase area cooperation included five representatives from the counties that share an area of the sub-basin, four from municipalities, three from water boards, three from agriculture, two from forestry, two from nature conservation/angling, one from the water supply company, one from industry, and two from the NLWKN. In contrast to most other area co-operations in Lower Saxony, which were chaired by NLWKN personnel, the Hase Area Co-operation elected a representative of the water board as chair. The list of stakeholders was created to focus on water users, rather than equal representation of stakeholder groups. The state environmental agency, NLWKN, was given responsibility for implementing requirements of the WFD. Area cooperations were supposed to generate lists of measures that are innovative, creative, and feasible. Leaders were urged to generate a common understanding of goals and measures, drawing on scientific knowledge as well as local experiences from those living in the area. Area cooperations were created because of a very strong focus on voluntary actions to address water quality problems rather than mandating certain measures from above. It was hoped that the area cooperations would have a strong role in implementing measures, which requires identifying responsible parties for them.

(c) Over time, it became apparent that the area cooperation’s goals to provide substantive input to the RBMP could not be met. The challenges to resolve pressing water quality issues, howerver, remained.

";3;3;Externally directed by law or authority;2;2;;3;3;2;2;;;;Yes;;Mostly confident;"Prior to the establishment of the area cooperations, a regional network of actors in the wider Hase area existed in the form of so-called drinking water cooperations. These were been established over the past 15 years to reduce nitrate pollution in groundwater used for supplying drinking water in a cooperative setting. In the form of contracts, farmers have pledged to undertake specific land use changes. To this end, they receive expert advice regarding optimized fertilization from the Chamber of Agriculture. Funded by the Ministry of the Environment, the concept has been highly successful, but also vastly expensive. Drinking-water cooperations have increased trust among participants and further stabilized the network of agriculture and water management (MU Niedersachsen, 2002). On the other hand, third-party interests such as environmental groups were excluded from the network. As a consequence, the reduction of diffuse nitrate pollution has so far been exclusively dealt with by the agricultural and water sector. There is certainly an awareness of agricultural nitrate pollution among environmental groups. Most representatives of regional environmental NGOs are very familiar with local water bodies, and also have a sound technical and legal knowledge of the WFD. Nevertheless, they exhibit a strong preference for nature conservation, concentrating on biological and hydromorphological issues rather than on nitrate pollution. Moreover, unlike many of the other important actors at this local scale, the vast majority of environmental expert representatives work on a voluntary basis, while NGOs’ full-time employees only work at the level of the federal state. This implies that local representatives of these NGOs have to invest their spare time by taking days off from work to participate in meetings, and that specific expertise regarding the WFD and nutrient issues varies greatly among individual representatives. All this contributes to the fact that there is virtually no advocate for effective groundwater protection in the Hase catchment.

(b) My ministerial decree, see above variable 13.

(c) Unclear, but probably relatively low.

(d) Incentives to collaborate declined as the area cooperations over time became less of a collaborative, deliberative effort but more of gatherings in which members would receive first-hand information by the NLWKN agency.

Most cooperations were chaired by a local NLWKN member, but the Hase cooperation elected a member of the water board (water maintenance association) as the chair. Water boards are corporations under public law, constituted and financed by land owners, with responsibilities for maintenance of smaller waterways, hydraulic engineering measures and land improvement in Lower Saxony. The process chair moderated meetings, distributed information to participants, and mediated in case of conflicts Nevertheless, NLWKN remained crucial in influencing agendas and providing key information. Meeting frequency (about four times a year) was broadly set by the state environmental ministry.

(b) Area cooperations aimed at a broad representativeness (although this was not the main criterion). In the Hase cooperation, there was a predominancy of municipal (cities and counties) actors. Whereas the Ministry decided on a maximum of 10 participants per area cooperation in an effort to guarantee a constructive working atmosphere, far more stakeholders than expected, particularly from the counties, wanted to participate. Since the Hase sub-basin encompasses six counties, the territories of which do not align with the boundaries of the river basin, administrative stakeholders were overrepresented in the process. Moreover, because of limited financial resources and personnel, none of the typical regional ENGOs participated; instead, the ENGOs nominated a representative of an angling association to participate on their behalf. According to an official assessment of the participatory process, although a seat was always reserved for environmental interests, they were also underrepresented in other area co-operations for the same reasons.

(c) While the stated role of the area cooperation was to compile measures for the RBMP, the group did not have the authority to make legally binding decisions, and the final decision remained with the Ministry, which merely considered the recommendations of the area co-operations. Overall, little is known about how ""decision-making"" actually occured. The lists of measures that were compiled appeared to have been ""decided"" more or less consensually. From other area-cooperations we know that there was usually consensus decision making, with votes taken only rarely. Besides deciding on how to come to collective decisions, an important consideration is who is eligible to do so. Although the Ministerial decree, in theory, envisioned decision making by ten permanent members of each area cooperation, in practice the groups had more participants. In addition, there were some interested stakeholders who participated “as needed” for some but not all of the meetings. This led to some uncertainty about voting rules. Rather than restricting voting to permanent members, it appears that in some instances everybody in attendance voted. 

(d) In the early phase of the process, participants were highly committed and actively engaged in discussions on WFD implementation. Interviewees described communication in the group as constructive and fair, and observed that divergent opinions were mutually understood and conflict among participants was rather low. In later phases, as it became apparent that the cooperations would be unable to impact strongly on RPMs,, the modus operandi shifted towards the NLWKN providing updates and information on current developments.

(b) Overall, relatively strong top-down approach with the NLWKN being the dominant actor (even where, as in the Hase area cooperation, the formal lead was taken by a water board member).

(b) Essentially two kinds of outcomes can be distinguished: (i) Contribution to RBMP by proposing and formulating local measures (= actions) for sustainable water management. Other contributions to RBMP (although these were the official aims of the area cooperations) were not made. (ii) Implementation of proposed measures by actors (mainly municipalities and maintenance organizations). It is not entirely clear how exactly measures were proposed, but as far as we know this was both bottom up (members suggesting measures) and top-down (NLWKN suggesting measures), followed by discussions and feasibility-checks by NLWKN. In 2008, the Hase Area Co-operation did agree on a list of measures, which was received by the MU and considered for inclusion into the RBMP.

(b) Generally, the area cooperations (and so the Hase area cooperation) worked relatively autonomous. The main outside interaction was with the central NLWKN administration, mostly through NLWKN members. Possibly, individual group members also connected with their respective constituencies (e.g. farmers associations), but this has not been documented.

The list included measures for which funding was available, as well as measures which were unlikely to be implemented due to a lack of resources.  Those measures, as produced by most if not all 28 area cooperations in Lower Saxony, were taken into account by central NLWKN staff and the Lower Saxonian environmental ministry. They were, however, only included in a highly aggregated way into the RBMP and the PoM, which had to be produced by 2009 to fulfil WFD obligations. In fact, these official plans did not contain any specific measures to be implemented to reach the WFD's goals. Rather, these documents provided a general overview of possible bundles of measures, for which it is not possible to identify individual measures for the Hase area, let alone for specific rivers or water bodies. The stated rationale for this was to “guarantee flexibility in implementation” over the long planning timeframe. However, even more importantly, the Lower Saxonian environmental ministry applied a strict principle of voluntary measures, which implied that no action was politically prescribed.

In addition to these outputs, data sheets for all water bodies were produced in 2012 by the NLWKN. However, it remains unclear whether or how the Area co-operation contributed to the production of these. The data sheets show that most measures (166 out of 297) address river connectivity, six of which was also identified by stakeholders as an important issue in the sub-basin. 44 measures address diffuse pollution stemming from agriculture, which is also a key pressure identified in the RBMP. Measures listed in the data sheets are specified for each water body, and are accompanied by specific recommendations for implementation. The PoM does not mention implementing addressees however. While measures included in the data sheets are very detailed, they do not address financing. Implementability of measures remains questionable.
(b) Acceptance of the main output (the PoM) and its implementation was mixed. The agriculture representative highlighted the fact that water status had at least not deteriorated, adding that “it was not by chance” that fish stocks had increased  In contrast, other stakeholders criticised poor representation of ecological interests and strong influence of agricultural interests in the process. According to the water supply company, the approach of relying solely on voluntary action was largely ineffective; rather, legislative changes to regulate agriculture would have been necessary to improve groundwater status. Overall, the area cooperations approach seems to have been largely ineffective in tackling the pressing water problems in Lower Saxony. According to a state official this was to a great extent due to the fact that farmers constituted the main group of non-state participants, and almost any effective action to combat the pressing nitrate problem would have been against the interests of farmers. The voluntary and partly collaborative approach taken thus did not deliver in a substantive sense.

(c) Measures were mostly proposed in the second half of the period under consideration.

The dam was built in the mid-1900s, so this new license would (in theory) bring the dam in line with current environmental and social values. Key issues raised in the relicensing process were: guaranteeing cheap, reliable electricity from the hydropower project; protecting downstream communities against flooding; providing recreational access (including boating and fishing in the reservoir and river); enhancing habitat for salmon and other fish species (including tribes with treaty rights to fish salmon). The goal of the collaboration was to develop a license that addressed as many of these issues as possible, and then to implement that license.

I divide this collaboration into three phases, each of which has fairly distinct goals:
1. Phase one (early phase) is initiation of the collaboration, determining what resources might be affected by the dam, conducting studies to quantify those impacts, and negotiating a settlement agreement re: how the dam should be operated such to minimize/enhance as many resources as possible. The settlement agreement directly informed the hydropower utility's license application to the regulatory agency (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or ""FERC"").
2. Phase 2 begins when the hydropower utility submitted the license application, so official decisions about the dam are out of the collaborative group's control. At this point, the collaborative group continued to meet, developing detailed plans for implementation of the settlement agreement.
3. Phase 3 begins after the new license was issued. At this point, there was no longer an external regulatory requirement to work together, but a subset of actors continue to meet regulatory and work on implementing the license.";2;6;Self-initiated by participants;4;4;Off;3;3;4;1;2;2;Off;Off;2;Mostly confident;"a. I have no information on the prehistory or past interactions of participants.
b. This collaboration is broadly regulated under the Federal Power Act. At the time the collaboration was initiated, hydropower utilities had one of two options for conducting the relicensing process. In the ""Traditional Licensing Process"", the utility would develop a license application unilaterally, and then other parties would have the opportunity to provide input after the application was submitted to FERC. In the ""Alternative Licensing Process"", the option selected by this utility, the utility would develop a settlement agreement with stakeholders, and the settlement agreement would essentially serve as the license application. Thus, the collaboration was suggested by FERC, but the utility chose to go above and beyond required levels of stakeholder engagement. The collaboration itself began with a stakeholder planning meeting hosted by the hydropower utility, with the aim of co-designing how the relicensing process would be structured.
c. The main incentive to participate in the collaboration was the idea that if a management requirement was included in the settlement agreement, it was more or less guaranteed by FERC to be in the official license. Thus, for all actors other than the utility, by participating in the collaboration they were more likely to have their individual interests (elk habitat, salmon, recreation, etc) included in the license than if they waited to submit formal written comments to FERC. For the utility, by collaborating with other stakeholders, they had more certainty over what changes would be required of them rather than waiting until FERC's final decision.
d. As the goals of the collaboration changed over each time period, so too did the incentives to collaborate. In particular, the primary incentive (having one's interests included in the settlement agreement and therefore license) was no longer present by the end of the first period. For the second and third phases, the main incentive to participate was to make sure that one's interests were best represented by the management plans developed and by how the new license was being developed. (Note that this shift did affect the number of stakeholders involved, as discussed in the next section.)";20+;20+;20+;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;Off;5;5;5;Off;Off;5;5;5;5;4;Off;5;Off;Mostly confident;"a. Ground rules were developed at many different levels, including an overall communications protocol, separate sets of ground rules developed internally by each technical working group (subsets of collaborative participants focused on distinct topic areas), and a set of ground rules for developing the settlement agreement. These rules were developed jointly by members of each individual working group. (Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the original documents, so cannot summarize what they contain.)

b. I define inclusiveness as the extent to which diverse participants were able to participate equally in decision-making. While the individuals involved in the collaboration fluctuated over time, throughout the two-decade process there was a diverse mix of organizations representing all of the key interests that one might expect (recreation, flood control, fishing, tribal rights, hydropower, etc). These organizations included federal agencies, state agencies, local governments, NGOs, Native American tribes, businesses, and private citizens. Additionally, decision-making influence was fairly equally distributed across all these individuals. Meetings were organized as shared discussions, with fairly equal representation regarding who spoke during meetings across organization types. And meetings moved locations to make them more convenient for attendees (and so a single organization wasn't always hosting).

c. Decision-making was quite transparent. All meetings were open to the public, and meeting summaries or more detailed minutes were published online for every meeting.

d. The stakeholder group did evolve over each phase. Attendance was fairly stable during the first phase, as an individual who attended one working group meeting was highly likely to attend the following meeting in that same working group. However, once the application was submitted, attendance became much more volatile, with high turnover in who participants were from meeting to meeting. In Phase 3 (license implementation), attendance again stabilized, although this time with a smaller subset of organizations than participated in developing the license. (All key interests were still represented during Phase 3, just fewer organizations.) Changes in the collaborative network are documented in detail in the Scott et al. (2018) reference.

I don't have any indication that either groundrules or transparency changed over time.";Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;4;4;Off;5;5;5;Off;Off;3;Off;Yes;5;Off;5;5;Mostly confident;"a. Leadership was fairly distributed across a variety of organizations. The lead organization--the hydropower utility--primarily served as a convening organization, inviting participants, securing meeting space, and funding the collaboration. Third-party facilitators were used for almost all meetings; they ran the meetings, prepared meeting minutes, and helped with overall planning of the process. The facilitators were selected by the full stakeholder group. Additionally, the utility hired technical consultants to conduct scientific studies, advise on potential management approaches, and oversee implementation of the license; the consultants were picked by the utility with input from other participants. Finally, a range of other organizations (including federal agencies, state agencies, tribal representatives, local governments, and NGOs) served in other leadership roles, including giving presentations during meetings and helping develop key decisions.
b. I think that having a fairly distributed leadership style made the process more inclusive and created opportunities for deliberation. Rather than having one or two actors/organizations shaping the agenda, decisions about what to do next were shared across multiple players. Additionally, by giving people a leadership role to play in the collaboration, it likely also created buy-in for continued participation (although this last point is my conjecture).
c. Overall, the general leadership trends were fairly consistent across each Phase, with one exception. The utility played more of a prominent role in shaping the content of meetings and discussions during Phase 1 than in subsequent phases.";5;5;5;Off;4;4;4;Off;4;5;2;Off;5;5;5;Off;4;4;2;Off;2;5;5;5;5;Off;Off;4;2;5;5;Off;Highly confident;"a. This process was very much oriented toward a deliberative, consensus-based process. Documents repeatedly mention consensus as a norm, and the group sought consensus on both small decisions like when to meet and large decisions like how to manage the dam. The vast majority of meetings (89% of meetings analyzed) used full group discussion, rather than having one or two participants give a presentation followed by an audience Q&A session. The group also aimed for an interest-based negotiation process, with explicit exercises to share participant interest (developed by the facilitation team).
The one exception to the deliberative process was a lawsuit filed by several local governments. Early in the process, the county government submitted a comment that it wanted to add flood control to the potential issues discussed, which they reiterated in repeated letters to FERC. Their requests were ultimately heard (to some extent), and the settlement agreement stipulated that additional flood control be added to project operations, subject to approval by a regulatory agency (USACE). However, the county and several municipal governments were still dissatisfied because they wanted flood storage to be certain and not be delayed by additional studies by USACE, so they sued the utility. After several years in the courts, the parties negotiated an agreement and signed an amendment to the original settlement in which the utility agreed to seek funding for modifications that would allow additional flood storage and the county agreed to cease any challenges to the settlement agreement. 
b. This process was heavily science based. The stakeholder group developed and hired consultants to carry out studies to assess whether current project operations affected resources of concern, like boating, temperature, and fish spawning habitat. Under the guidance of a facilitator, resource-specific working groups (such as Aquatics or Recreation) then used study results to identify key problems and to draft Protection, Mitigation, and Enhancement measures (“PM&Es” in relicensing jargon) to solve the problems. Consider, for example, the Aquatics working group's process. After hearing the results of the studies, the facilitator took stakeholders' interest statements and framed them into 52 issues. A utility representative then narrowed this list to eight overarching issues, which were shared with working group members “to see that the interests of their organizations [were] represented” (meeting minutes, July 11, 2002) and to flag areas that needed additional data before solutions could be identified. The working group then brainstormed management ideas, using a computational model to test the impacts of potential scenarios on resources. Some ideas did not move forward (for instance a suggestion to create unique flows for wet vs. dry water year types), while others did. In discussing requirements, stakeholders regularly mentioned specific constraints—for instance, the utility needing to generate power during high-demand times of day—that informed the decisions. Through this iterative process, they developed the final recommendations that fed into the final settlement agreement.
c. The orientation toward deliberation and consensus lasted through all three phases, but the desired outputs and outcomes changed (as will be discussed later).";5;4;4;Off;3;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;4;4;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Reasonably confident;"a. The members of each working group co-developed a mission statement, which directed their overall goals. These mission statements were regularly revisited during meetings. Additionally, during each meeting, action items were recorded (things that needed to happen and who was responsible for ensuring that those things happened); these were captured in the meeting notes. At the following meeting, the group would revisit the action items and follow up on any that were outstanding.

b. The collaboration was primarily accountable to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which set deadlines for key submissions and set up the regulatory framework for how decision making would proceed. As such, the collaborative group sent regular (annual) updates to FERC on the status of their decision-making, including describing the collaborative process they were using. However, FERC didn't really have oversight over the collaboration itself--they only cared that needed decisions were reached on time. (In fact, there are many other FERC relicensing processes that do not use collaboration at all.) The group's decisions were also statutorily required to be consistent with the goals of several other regulatory agencies, including the Washington Department of Ecology, the US Fish & Wildlife Service, the US Forest Service, and the National Marine Fisheries Service; representatives of each of these organizations participated in the collaboration, and served as the conduit for accountability to higher-ups in their organizations. I have no evidence of other outside bodies, including elected officials, playing much of a role re: accountability.

c. The primary shift in accountability dynamics during the relicensing was that in Phase 3, FERC's role as an oversight body changed somewhat. Before the license was issued, FERC was responsible for setting broad time lines, reviewing submissions by the utility/collaboration, and issuing decisions on open questions (like determining final lists of scientific studies). After license issuance, FERC played a smaller role, instead just receiving annual reports about how the license was being implemented.

The primary output of the collaboration (and the primary reason the collaboration existed) was the new operating license for the hydropower project. Compared to a number of other licenses I've evaluated, the Baker license is quite innovative in its ability to meet the needs of a number of different stakeholder interests (with the same limited supply of water). According to the license, operating requirements serve to protect or enhance “fish and wildlife resources, riparian vegetation, aesthetic resources, water quality, recreation resources, [and] flood control” in addition to energy production—a diverse suite of resources. To meet these needs, the requirements set very detailed minimum and maximum instream flow requirements, changing on a weekly or monthly basis depending on the key resources at that time (e.g,. when fish are spawning, when whitewater boating is popular). The license also stipulated construction of two new generating units, to allow the utility more flexibility in regulating downstream flows and increasing power production.

b. In a survey of participants in the relicensing, average responses (on a scale of 1-7, with seven being the highest) to the following questions were: 
- Overall, how effective was the relicensing process in developing a new license? 6.3
- How would you rate the quality of working relationships that developed between you and other participants? 6.0
- How enthusiastic would you be to work with the same group of participants in another relicensing? 5.5
- Overall, to what extent does the license reflect an innovative approach to managing hydropower resources? 5.2
- Overall, to what extent did the relicensing process help to minimize power differences between
participants? 4.8

Each of these numbers is substantially higher than the mean across all 24 relicensings that I surveyed, indicating fairly high satisfaction with the outcomes of the relicensing.

c. It's very hard to distinguish particular outcomes from each phase. The settlement agreement (which basically captured what would eventually become the license) marked the end of Phase 1, the actual license issuance marked the end of phase 2. As for collective outcomes, I don't have data on changes in social learning or problem solving capacity over time.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

a) This collaborative effort focused primarily on the problems of eutrophication and habitat loss/degradation in the Delaware Inland Bays.  Eutrophication (i.e., nutrient loading) comes primarily from urban land use (sewers, septic systems, stormwater) and agriculture (chicken farms and disposal of manure on surrounding farmland).  These water quality problems are important because the bays are located adjacent to the barrier beaches that are an important part of the summer tourism industry.  

b) Since the problems are the product of lots of small land use decisions and uses, improving water quality requires a large set of small corrective actions over a sustained period.  While the participants lacked specific goals in terms of the desired level of water quality improvement, they were motivated by a desire to address the problem.

c) The dynamics of the problem remain largely unchanged since the first collaborative efforts to address the water quality problems in the 1960s.  Development of this rural watershed continues.  Once the beachfront areas were fully developed, residential development has extending inland and the year round population has grown.  Additional housing means additional nutrient loadings.  Similarly, the region remains home to a significant poultry industry with manure deposited on farmland throughout the watershed.  Since groundwater discharges are an important source of nutrients to surface waters, there is an added time dimension to the problem that ensures it will last for some time.  The residence time for groundwater is anywhere between 15 – 40 years in the system so it will take sustained action for decades to fully address the problem.

";4;3;Externally directed by law or authority;2;2;Off;3;3;2;2;5;4;Off;Off;3;Highly confident;"a) The earliest collaborative efforts began in 1967 when the state planning office began working with Sussex County and the soil conservation district to address some of the environmental problems from residential development.  In 1969, the Governor met with state and local officials and issued his own report that raided attention to the water quality problems in the watershed.  The passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 then stimulated a section 208 plan for the region.  By the early 1980s, the problems led to the creation of the Inland Bays Study Group, which consisted mostly of state agency staff, local agencies, and a few influential citizens.  It produced some issue papers and a report by the University of Delaware Sea Grant Program.  This led the Governor to sign an executive order establishing the Governor’s Task Force on the Inland Bays.  The task force issued its own report in 1984.  The Governor then signed another executive order establishing the Inland Bays Monitoring Committee (IBMC), which was to last 5 years and was provided with a small budget to fund a support staff.  

b) DENREC and other state officials became aware of the discussions surrounding the development of the National Estuary Program (NEP) as part of the CWA reauthorization.  They then worked with Senator Roth and lobbied EPA Region III to be included in the list of estuaries for priority consideration.  Once the legislation passed, the used the research and recommendations from the prior efforts to create their nomination package and gain entry to the EPA’s NEP to initiate another round of collaborative planning.  They also hoped that the NEP designation would help them attract additional federal funds to support their ongoing implementation efforts in the bay.  

c) There has always been a good sense of interdependence between DENREC (the state water quality agency) and local officials regarding the nature of the water quality problems.  Since resources to address the problem have typically been lacking (it is still largely a poor rural county) there is a long track record of DENREC working with the county to address water quality issues.  There is more of a disconnect with the agricultural industry in that it does not like being portrayed as the main source of the problems.  There was also less involvement of the industry and the department of agriculture in the process initially.  Interestingly, even though 95 percent of the roads in DE are state roads, there was little involvement of DEDOT in the process.  

d) The big change that occurred during the planning process was a growing recognition that the water quality problems were intimately connected to land use.  EPA and its counter parts in DENREC largely focused initial efforts at trying to understand how the ecological system functioned and were focused on modeling water quality rather than on understanding the sources of nutrient loadings.  As the focus shifted in this direction as the planning process went on, it became increasingly clear that new stakeholders needed to be involved from the agricultural industry.  However, this was a shift from prior efforts and complicated the politics of the collaboration because the agricultural industry is very powerful and earlier collaborative efforts largely did not involve these interests. ";6-okt;20+;6-okt;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;4;Off;3;2;4;4;Off;2;3;4;4;3;Off;3;Off;Highly confident;"
a) The collaboration was required to use consensus decision making, although it never really defined consensus.  In practice, they used an iterative process that involved multiple drafts of controversial aspects of the plan to reach agreement on wording.  The membership in the committee structure (i.e., management conference) was structured.  A 4-member executive council led the effort.  The notable omission from the council with the secretary of agriculture.  There was then a 32-member implementation committee that consisted of various agency officials as well as the chair of the Science and Technical Advisory Committee and a Citizen Advisory Committee.  This committee structure developed the plan.

b) The process was largely inclusive by the time the plan was being developed.  Initially, some of the agricultural interests were not represented.  This was not intentional but reflected the way previous efforts had been structured where agricultural issues and water quality issues were largely addressed by different processes and programs.  Once it became clear the issues needed to be addressed simultaneously the committee structure was adjusted (Executive Committee added the Secretary of Agriculture).  The STAC and CAC also provided active forums for involvement because they included citizens who were involved in prior planning efforts in the basin.  

c) The process was largely transparent until it got near the end of the process.  In order to address some of the problems that the agricultural industry had with the plan, there were some closed-door meetings to resolve the wording and a controversial figure was removed that portrayed agricultural land as the main source of nutrient loadings.  However, many participants did not realize this occurred until they saw the final plan and there was a perception that this was caving in to the agricultural industry.  The EPA also forced other changes to both the plan content and substance that were resisted by the state.  In fact, the EPA had planned to reject the final CCMP until some last minute political maneuvering on the part of the Governor got the EPA administrator to change her mind.  Interestingly, the EPA’s threat to reject the CCMP helped galvanize all sides in further support of the CCMP including the Agricultural industry.  

d) Once the planning process neared completion, the parties tried to determine a new structure that could oversee the implementation of the CCMP and structure future collaboration.  The settled on a collaborative structure that was initially called an Implementation Council that would have the various cabinet secretaries, County Administrator, and representatives of the STAC and CAC, which would be retained and left to function as separate committees (effectively serving as citizen representatives.  The council met three times and what eventually emerged was support for the creation of a Section 501(c)3 organization called the Center for the Inland Bays that was chartered by an act of the state legislature.  The Implementation council also drafted the by-laws for the CIB, which is required to meet at least quarterly.  The CIB continues to this day.

a) Rather than a traditional hierarchical leadership structure, leadership was distributed.  During the planning process, the project was funded through DENREC but the program staff worked at the direction of the executive/implementation committee in much the same fashion that prior efforts functioned.  The prior planning efforts developed a set of individuals who were quite knowledgeable about the Bay’s problems, filled various roles on different committees, and then went on to serve as board members in the CIB.  These were the same champions for using the nonprofit organizational model to make sure that the program remained independent.  

b) While much of the leadership was shared, there were instances where the leadership of particular individuals (traditional hierarchical leaders) was needed.  These mostly involved negotiating the wording of the final plan to gain approval of the agricultural interests and negotiating with the EPA.

c) The leadership dynamics emerged prior to the collaborative planning effort for the NEP and remain largely unchanged.  The main difference was that for the period involved in developing the CCMP, they were required by EPA to use their mandated structure, which imposed a more elaborate committee structure than they were used to dealing with as well as pushed the program to do more research and less implementation as part of the process of plan development.  Once the plan was approved, they moved to the CIB structure that works more like earlier pre-NEW processes.

Plan development was primarily and iterative process involving the review of subsequent drafts, as they were refined based on comments and feedback.  The focus was mostly on producing a document similar to those produced in prior efforts.  However, the EPA tried to pull the process in a different direction by trying to force a much more detailed and highly structured plan.  This created quite a bit of tension between state and local officials and their EPA counterparts.  Similarly, the agricultural industry was largely silent during the plan’s development and many assumed this meant they supported the document.  However, that turned out not to be the case and near the end of the process the agricultural interests forced some changes in the plan’s content as well.  

b) The plan never focused on formulating any shared goals or outcomes.  Since the agricultural industry at the time was fearful that the plan was going to be used for regulatory purposes by either EPA or DENREC, it is unlikely that any specific goals or reductions would have been agreed to.  

c) The process changed once the CCMP was adopted and the CIB was created.  Since the CCMP was not developed with the CIB in mind, it has not proven to be useful in guiding the decision making of the new organization.  However, the CIB has managed to initiate a number of collaborative project in the watershed that address water quality issues.  

";3;4;2;Off;3;3;2;Off;3;3;2;Off;3;3;2;3;3;3;Off;Off;2;2;2;Off;4;4;4;Off;2;4;3;2;Off;4;2;2;2;3;3;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Highly confident;"a) The collaboration never developed any formal goals such as nutrient reductions and has not monitored progress in terms of implementing the CCMP recommendations.

b) The CIB does provide a forum for discussing Bay problems, provides effective oversight in terms of how EPA funding is allocated and spent, and provides a mechanism for stimulating other collaborations between organizations in the watershed.  

c) The interesting thing is the efforts the preceded the NEP and the efforts post CCMP development appear to have more productive dynamics in terms of keeping the focus on actions that can lead to water quality improvements.  In retrospect, the NEP planning process was largely unnecessary since the local actors knew what actions were possible either in terms of political and economic realities.  Instead, EPA pushed for a plan that would not have been consistent with the realities and had a form and content that was less useful to the organizations that became part of the CIB.

Unlike the prior planning efforts, this one has some permanence and fills an important void by securing regular communication among state agencies and local government, which typically do not collaborate on a regular basis.  This creates opportunities for a wide range of smaller collaborations that likely would not have occurred.  

b) However, the charter for the nonprofit also effectively limits what the CIB can do to address problems in the watershed.  These efforts are largely related to habitat restoration and environmental education.  It is prohibited from lobbying and has to avoid controversial land use issues.  As a result, one of the unintended consequences is that this leaves it unable to address many aspects of the land development and agriculture loadings that stimulated prior planning efforts.

c) While governance has undoubtedly improved, it is an open question whether they are making substantial progress towards improving water quality.

a) The Narragansett Bay Project, as it was originally called, was a collaborative effort designed to address the environmental problems in the Narragansett Bay watershed.  While the watershed includes part of Massachusetts, there was limited involvement from any officials from this part of the watershed.  When it was established initially, it was modeled on the Chesapeake Bay Program and almost all of the initial funding went to research various problems affecting the water quality in the Bay. In 1988, it became part of the EPA’s National Estuary Program (NEP) and was required to utilize their collaborative planning process.  The collaborative effort addressed a wide range of different problems, but there was no focal issue(s) that drove the effort.

b) To this day, there still are no clear or measurable goals or outcomes.  The goal statements are broad and general.  They did manage to produce 41 high priority action items, but they read more like plan recommendations some of which include particular outputs (change in a policy). 
 
c) There have been several attempts to revive the “process” and produce a new planning document but these efforts have not been successful in identifying a focal issue(s) to motivate collaboration and the effort still lacks clear measurable goals.

";5;1;Externally directed by law or authority;3;3;Off;2;2;3;1;2;2;Off;Off;2;Highly confident;"
a) The NBP was by no means the first collaborative effort to address environmental problems in the watershed.  There were literally dozens of prior efforts dating back to the late 1800s and subsequent efforts targeted at sub-basins in the watershed.  Therefore, participants had a long history of interaction and in some cases a long history of conflict between particular actors.  In particular, there was a long history of conflict between the state coastal program, the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), and the state water quality agency, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM).  Rather than using the collaborative process to help resolve these differences, the collaborative planning process created further division and exacerbated conflicts between the agencies.

b) The state received a grant from the EPA that was modeled on the Chesapeake Bay Program, to study the bay.  The grants were earmarks and provided welcome research funding.  When the Clean Water Act was amended in 1987, Narragansett Bay was included as an original member of the EPA’s newly established National Estuary Program (NEP) and was designated by the federal statute.  Rather than create a separate program office that was independent of one of the agencies, the RIDEM decided to locate the program within the agency and the created an elaborate committee structure called a management conference pursuant to EPA guidance.

c) The was relatively little sense of interdependence between participants.  This is likely because there was no driving focal issue or problem that was perceived to be important or any problem that appeared to be worsening.  In fact, the scientific consensus near the end of the planning process was that the bay suffered from a low-grade fever caused by a series of much smaller problems that were often isolated in particular geographic areas.  Moreover, by addressing a wide range of problems from different causes there was no sense of importance to any particular issue or problem.  In essence, if everything is important nothing was that important.  

d) This general lack of a focal issue and lack of interdependence has more or less remained the same to this day.  That said, there are other particularly notable collaborations that have subsequently occurred in other sub-basins of for other issues within the watershed (e.g., Greenwich Bay, Narragansett Bay Commission).  In these efforts, a driving issue created a sense of interdependence for actors to work collaborative not just to develop a plan or set of goals but also to then become engaged in a sustained effort to make progress implementing the plan or making progress towards the goal. 

";20+;20+;16-20;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;1;Off;1;1;3;1;Off;3;3;5;3;2;Off;1;Off;Highly confident;"a) As a member of the EPA’s National Estuary Program, the Narragansett Bay Project had to make decisions based on consensus and had to adopt a committee structure known as a management conference.  There was a high-level executive committee that was EPA and agency heads.  It did not meet frequently to make decisions until near the end of the planning process where it was instrumental in resolving the conflict surrounding the draft management plan.  The management committee was the main decision making body and consisted of 45 members that represented various stakeholders and agency department heads.  The decision making process during the planning process was a bit dysfunctional.  Sometimes votes were taken.  It was unclear what “consensus” actually means because near the end of the process lots of agencies and departments voiced the same concerns in comments that they had voiced years earlier during management committee meetings.  The NBP staff’s role and relationship to the management committee was never clear either.  Rather than facilitating meetings and working to broker agreements between parties, they often took sides in ongoing agency disputes and effectively became a stakeholder in the process with its own agenda.

b) The management committee was inclusive to a fault.  The large number of committee members made it difficult to discuss issues collaboratively.  Many had little knowledge, interest, or concern in some problems that were discussed but their opinions were weighted equally.  At the same time, while the management committee was very inclusive, there was little effort to educate or involve the public or the other stakeholders that were not included (e.g., local governments).

c) The meetings were open to the public and the process was relatively transparent.  Briefing papers for various issues were prepared, released for comment, and then discussed at the management committee meetings.  The staff then turned the briefing papers into draft chapters of the plan.

d) Once the plan was adopted, the management conference was disbanded.  A new office within RIDEM was established to oversee the plan’s implementation.  A new implementation committee was established that was more manageable in size (an expanded Executive committee).  The new program was supposed to be guided by this committee but it never really functioned as designed.  Instead, it met 1-2 times a year to provide general guidance and feedback oriented around how to spend EPA’s monies.  There was little to know monitoring of plan implementation and no overarching goal to how to spend the money.  Much of the funding was spent on collaborative projects involving some subset of the earlier management conference members or other stakeholders in the watershed.  In 2012, the NBEP finally updated its management plan and created a new management committee to oversee its implementation.  However, this was too little, too late and given the lack of substantive progress and a series of organizational issues, the EPA gave the program a failing grade during its biennial review in 2012.  The Management Committee submitted a corrective action report in 2013 that included moving the program out of RIDEM to the New England Water Pollution Control Commission (NEWPCC) and hired a new executive director to try to move the collaboration in a more productive direction.  

";Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;1;2;1;Off;1;2;1;Off;2;1;2;Off;1;Off;1;2;Highly confident;"
a) In many ways, the case is an interesting example of failed leadership.  The director of the Narragansett Bay Project (NBP) clearly envisioned that she was the “leader” of the program and the collaborative process.  As a result, she had a tendency to view the management committee as if it were an advisory committee while the members were led to believe that that they were co-equal decision makers.  This led to a dysfunctional planning process and conflicts between the director and staff and the draft plan was dead in the water once it was released.  The director was then replaced and the successor had more of a facilitative approach and tried to work to address many of the issues with the draft plan.

b) Since the executive committee met infrequently, the NBP director and staff really worked for themselves rather than for the executive/management committee.  The EPA also exhibited little leadership until the process grew dysfunctional and almost fell apart when the draft plan was released.  Once the Executive Committee leadership of the effort was restored and NBP staff were directed to work with stakeholders to address their issues, many of the problems with the plan were resolved.  The lone exception was the belief on the part of EPA/RIDEM that they could force the CRMC to accept recommendations that they opposed.  This effort also failed and the plan was finally approved once all members of the executive committee accepted that they all had co-equal roles or co-ownership over the final version of the document and agreed that it had to be acceptable to all parties.

c) The collaborative effort has mostly suffered from a series of failed attempts at traditional hierarchical leadership as noted above.  The director’s leadership style and unwillingness to work to find compromise between affected stakeholders largely led to the problems with the draft plan.  A new director to oversee implementation efforts replaced the interim director who managed to forge compromises.  This individual was simply ineffective and lacked either the interest or ability to forge collaborations to implement the plan.  The plan also provided little in the way of direction or vision to guide the new staff director.  Since the Implementation Committee met infrequently, there was little opportunity to have any collaborative leadership.  This led to a period of relatively limited collaborative activity beyond the projects funded by the EPA.  The current efforts to hire a new director, move the location, and effectively reboot the collaborative effort have shown little progress so far.  

";3;5;1;Off;3;5;1;Off;2;4;1;Off;4;2;1;Off;3;2;2;Off;4;4;3;1;1;Off;Off;1;2;2;3;Off;Highly confident;"
a) The actors interacted quite frequently (monthly or more) during the planning process from 88 – 92.  They have interacted relatively infrequently since then 1-2 times per year with the exception of a few pulses of committee activity that were oriented around attempts to revise the management plan or respond to inquiries or requests from EPA.  

b) While eventually the actors agreed to a management plan with 100s of recommendations and 41 high priority actions, they never really formulated or achieved any shared outcomes.  Most of what was agreed to were actions that were already planned or underway.  When examining the 41 high priority actions in 2000, it was hard to find any actions that occurred due specifically to the collaborative partnership.  That said, the program did complete some innovative projects that were collaborative in nature using EPA implementation funding

c) The process changed after the plan was adopted in that the executive/management committee structure was abandoned for a more streamlined implementation/management committee that met less frequently.  What is also interesting is that for 20 years, the collaborative partnership received implementation funding from EPA’s NEP and it never functioned effectively.  EPA cited these concerns during the biennial reviews in 1997, 1999, 2001, 2006, 2009 but received passing grades.  It was not until the review in 2012 that it finally took action on these concerns and tried to reboot the failed collaborative partnership.

a) There was never any formal goal setting process.  They were actually added after the planning process was completed rather than being used to drive the process.  In essence, the process involved developing a briefing paper that synthesized the research and provided options for addressing the problems.  They were released for comment and then reviewed by the management committee.  Staff then took the document and converted it to a draft chapter in a comprehensive conservation and management plan.  In some cases, this was years after it had been discussed before the management committee.  Since the planning process took about 5 years, once the plan was released many of the management committee members had not been party to the earlier discussions, funding priorities had changed, and in some cases new legislation had been passed that required new approaches to addressing problems.  Thus, when the draft plan was released, it met with a lot of opposition.  A prioritization process was used to try to identify the high priority recommendations but this consisted of 41 recommendations.  There was no process in place to measure any progress towards the priority actions.  In fact, once the plan was approved most of the actors had no interest in implementing or following its recommendations even though it was incorporated into the state guide plan.

b) One of the main problems is that the participants in the management committee were unable to hold the NBP staff accountable.  The executive committee also never really met.  At one point, it was unclear for whom the NBP staff were actually working.  In fact, they rather viewed themselves as unaccountable and though that was a strength of the program.  The director believed that it was her job to hold the agencies accountable and thought it was her job to tell them how they should do their jobs and what their priorities should be.  Obviously, this did not work but that is how the process grew so dysfunctional.

c) Once the rogue director was terminated, the process became more functional but the general lack of accountability remained.  For approximately 20 years the partnership received “implementation” funding with no guiding goals or expectations for what to do and little accountability or involvement of the partners in the development of work plans or projects.

a) There really were not outputs beyond the science (the studies did produce a lot of useful information) and the individual implementation projects funded by EPA, several of which were quite useful and provided benefits to multiple stakeholders.  Some of the plan was implemented, but these actions were underway during plan development.  Progress was also made in addressing some of the problems because of both individual and collaborative efforts that were recommended in the plan, but when interviewed most of the respondents though these would have occurred anyway as well.

b) The goals were so general it is hard to say whether any progress was made.  The collaboration had little to no impact on decision-making or problem solving.  There was one unintended consequence.  There is quite a long history of planning to address water quality problems in Narragansett Bay dating back to the late 1800s.  However, EPA’s continuation of the program given its lack of progress has made it difficult to establish a new effort.  Conversely, the experience was so bad; many participants are reluctant to become engaged in any large-scale watershed wide planning efforts.  The upside is that they now prefer more focused single issue or smaller focused collaborative planning efforts that have been quite effective.  

c) In terms of water quality, Narragansett Bay continues to improve due to improved waste treatment and efforts to address combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in the upper bay but these largely occurred due to other collaborative efforts.

a) When Rhode Island was developing its federally approved coastal management program, concerns were raised at a series of hearings that the Salt Ponds region needed special policies to protect its sensitive natural resources and manage the development pressure that the region was experiencing.  However, state officials did not have any data or scientific information to validate or justify the claims made at public hearings.  The state coastal zone management agency, the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), agreed to form a partnership with researchers at the University of Rhode Island (URI) Coastal Resources Center (CRC) to investigate the ecological problems and then develop a special area management plan to manage the area.

b) The goals of the partnership were to embark on an ambitious research effort to understand the ecology of the Salt Ponds by pooling financial resources from a variety of funding sources and to then work collaboratively with the municipalities to develop a management plan.

c) Once researchers had a firm understanding of the connection between land use and nutrient loadings from septic systems it became clear that new policies were needed to better control the density and corresponding nutrient loadings and that new buffer zone, wetland protection, erosion and sediment control, and stormwater controls were needed.  These policies were in effect negotiated between local officials and the state agency with scientists from URI facilitating the discussions.  Three communities and the state adopted the plan in 1984.  The state enforced policies for large development projects and local governments amended their zoning ordinances to regulate single-family homes and small commercial projects.  A fourth community joined the plan in 1986.  Denitrification requirements began to be enforced by the state water quality agency, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), in 1994.  In 1999, the plan and its policies were revised again based on the results of a study of the effectiveness of the plan’s 1984 policies. 

";2;2;Self-initiated by participants;3;4;Off;4;5;4;5;3;5;Off;Off;5;Highly confident;"
a) The CRC served as the planning staff for the development of the CRMC’s federally approved coastal resource management program so they had a close working relationship.  They also worked closely with researchers who were conducting their research on the Salt Ponds ecosystem.  It also turns out that many of the researchers at URI’s Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO) lived in the watershed.  The local governments also interacted with the CRMC due to the state permit process.  These interactions were mixed in terms of the level of conflict.

b) During the hearings, leading up to the state and federal approval of the coastal resource management program it was clear that the public wanted special protection for the Salt Ponds region.  The CRMC agreed and once again turned to CRC to serve as its staff to both complete the research needed to support these policies and to produce the plan that would eventually become part of its federally approved coastal resource management program.  The CRC then worked to leverage funding from a variety of sources to complete the research while federal funding from NOAA’s coastal zone program was used to support plan development.

c) There was a sense of interdependence.  Citizens were supportive of protecting the unique quality of life that the Salt Ponds region provided, which was strongly linked to maintaining the vitality of its ecological system.  These vocal citizens included faculty from URI, many of whom lived in or near the watershed.  However, the state water quality agency was less involved and much less supportive of the effort.  Similarly, the town of Westerly initially resisted participating in the plan when it was first developed.  Similarly, since each town was going to “downzone” land and give up future property tax revenue, it took quite a bit of convincing and about a year of negotiation to get everyone on the same page even though their interests were pretty much aligned at the start of the process.  

d) The changes that occurred are best characterized as incremental in nature where the general institutional framework was gradually refined over time.  Westerly joined the plan in 1986 and amended its zoning ordinances.  The centralized permit review process recommended in the plan was jettisoned for a more informal process, which eventually served as a model for changes in Rhode Island subdivision review process.  The plan’s policies for denitrifying septic systems were ahead of the technology and RIDEM was reluctant to implement them.  However, by 1994, the CRMC and RIDEM entered into an MOU to enforce them.  The plan was further amended in 1999 after doing a comprehensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of the 1984 policies.

a) I am not sure that any formal ground rules were ever established.  The goals were clear – produce a management plan for the watershed.  What the management plan would consist of were policies that would be implemented through the CRMC’s permit process.  However, the CRMC lacked the staff capacity to regulate all single-family homes so this necessitated a partnership with the local governments who had to regulate these structures anyway.  Since the CRC developed the original coastal zone program and managed the public participation process very effectively, the assumption was simply that they would develop and utilize a participatory process.

b) The CRC used an interesting participatory process that included both formal public meetings and informal dinner seminars that were held to educate local officials (e.g., planning boards, zoning boards, etc.) about the scope of the ecological problems and convinced them that policies were needed to protect the ponds. An ecological history of the region was also prepared that was then made available at local bookstores to help educate the public (it was a local best seller).  The CRMC also created a formal advisory committee consisting of interest groups, municipal officials, and state agencies to initiate a structured process of negotiation from 1983-1984 that approved the research findings and its management measures.  The CRC then worked directly with each of the municipalities to enact the zoning changes necessary to implement the plan’s density requirements. 

c) While the advisory committee meetings were transparent and open, the process included many informal interactions, discussions, and negotiations that were critical to getting the local buy in needed to enact the zoning changes needed to successfully implement the plan.  The final plan met with no substantive opposition and received mostly favorable comments so the process seemed to work well.

d) The regulatory structure remains largely unchanged.  Local governments implement the plan’s policies and density requirements for single family homes, subdivisions of 5 units or less, and small commercial projects.  A CRMC permit is required for subdivisions of six units or more and larger commercial projects and an informal project review occurs for larger projects with local governments and developers.  The changes that occurred are best characterized as incremental in nature where the general institutional framework was gradually refined over time.  Westerly joined the plan in 1986 and amended its zoning ordinances.  The centralized permit review process recommended in the plan was jettisoned for a more informal process, which eventually served as a model for changes in Rhode Island subdivision review process.  The plan’s policies for denitrifying septic systems were ahead of the technology and RIDEM was reluctant to implement them.  However, by 1994, the CRMC and RIDEM entered into an MOU to enforce them.  The plan was further amended in 1999 after doing a comprehensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of the 1984 policies.

a) During the plan’s development, a few key staff from the CRC provided the critical leadership needed to move the process forward.  They had a unique ability to communicate the science in a way the key local officials (council members, zoning boards, planning boards) could understand.  Given their affiliation with URI, they were also viewed as honest brokers who could be trusted.  As the process shifted to plan development, the planners in the local communities became critical to getting the local buy in needed to enact the local zoning changes that are the heart of the partnership.  

b) Interestingly, once the plan was adopted and the municipalities changed their zoning ordinances there really has not been a “leader” as the term is classically used.  The management plan envisioned a coordinated permit review process led by the CRMC.  However, this process never materialized due to staffing limitations and the reality that it simply would have deferred to other agencies’ expertise anyway and many small projects would not warrant the expense this centralized process would occur.  Instead, an informal process emerged for larger projects that brings local government and CRMC staff together with developers (RIDEM staff participation varies).  This process later served as a model for changes to RI’s subdivision review process.  In short, there really is no “leader”.  Local governments implement the same policies that the CRMC and RIDEM implement and for larger projects, they meet informally to exchange information and explain what is required by developers to ensure compliance with their respective policies.  

c) See above.

a) A critical part of the process was the joint fact-finding.  This involved two basic components.  First, the scientists coordinates their researcher efforts that were funding because of pooling financial resources from various sources.  The scientists would then regularly share their findings to reach consensus on what the implications of nitrogen loadings from septic systems were.  The CRC then worked to educate state agency, local officials, and the public about these findings.  Much of this education was relatively informal.  The formal advisory committee also engaged in a formal fact finding process.  The management plan includes a detailed set of findings that are used as the justification for promulgating additional regulatory policies beyond those required in other areas of the state.  

b) The shared outcomes in this case was to ensure that the total nutrient loadings to groundwater from septic systems would be maintained at a safe level.  Unconstrained development on septic systems presented to potential problems.  Excessive nitrogen loadings could render the groundwater unsafe to drink.  The corresponding discharge of groundwater to the shallow estuaries in the Salt Ponds could also produce excessive nutrient loadings that led to eutrophic events.  Thus, once scientists produced an estimate of safe loadings to groundwater, the CRC had to work with towns and the CRMC to establish a density overlay that would manage loadings and then change zoning where needed.  

c) In 1994, the CRMC got a grant to evaluate the effectiveness of the density overlays.  For the most part, the policies seemed to be working but the investigation did find several areas were additional zoning and policy changes were needed and these were adopted in 1999.

a) Essentially, the goals of the collaboration are the shared policies, particularly the shared density requirements for septic systems.  These densities then correspond to estimated annual nutrient loadings.

b) The state agencies and local governments all have formal permit review processes that are open to the public and subject to various oversight bodies.  Accordingly, it is relatively easy for the partners to monitor each other and for the public to monitor each partner’s compliance with the plan’s policies.  The informal permit review process on larger projects provides not only a means for the local government and state agencies to coordinate but to also monitor their respective compliance with the policies as well.

c) These dynamics have remained largely unchanged since 1985.

a) There are several products of the collaboration: The Salt Ponds Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) (revised in 1999); Revised zoning ordinances in Charlestown, Narragansett, South Kingston, Westerly; MOU on denitrification between CRMC and RIDEM (although limited implementation by RIDEM); and all of the permits issues in accordance with these policy changes.  There were also habitat restoration projects and land acquisition initiated that are consistent with the SAMP.  

b) The study of groundwater in 1994 indicated that water quality had improved in some areas but not others so the policies in the plan were modified in 1999.  For the most part, the plan has achieved its goals and remains effective in managing development in the watershed.  There were no unintended consequences I am aware of.  Instead, the SAMP was designed to avoid the unintended consequences of a much easier solution to the problem of nutrient loadings from septic systems, which would have been installing sewers to remove loadings throughout the watershed.  However, this would have led to the unintended consequences of habitat loss (easier to build in many areas once sewers are available) and loss of groundwater and potentially salt-water intrusion because it is the main source of drinking water.

c) The Salt Ponds SAMP remains a rather unique partnership between a state agency and local governments to manage development and the ecological and human health impacts that septic systems can have.  It remains popular and is well supported by the public, interest groups, local officials, and state officials.

This clarity has been declining since the 1950s because of development activities that increased the flow of nutrients and sediments to the lake.  Where it was once about 100 feet, today it is about 70 feet.  While the efforts are designed to address a wide range of environmental problems in the basin, declining clarity is the focal issue that motivated the creation of the federal interstate compact and current collaborative efforts.

b) The desired outcome is actually unrealistic in the sense that it is not practicable to restore lack clarity because the lake has a 700-year residence time.  The goal is really to stabilize and halt the decline so that improvements can begin to occur.

c) The goals or environmental thresholds remain unchanged since they were first adopted in 1982.  However, the understanding of the causes has changed considerably.  There is not widespread acceptance that even if no new development were allowed, that clarity would continue to decline due to poor development decisions made from the 1960s and 1970s.  Thus, current efforts largely focus on environmental improvements through redevelopment and restoration.

";2;1;Self-initiated by participants;2;3;Off;2;3;3;5;2;3;Off;Off;5;Highly confident;"a) This case has a complex set of stakeholders.  The first effort at collaboration was the creation of the Lake Tahoe Area Council (LTAC) in 1959, a nonprofit organization representing an array of basin interests but it was focused mostly on economic development rather than environmental protection.  They did manage to help foster the creation of the Tahoe Regional Planning Commission (TRPC), which was an advisory commission comprised of the planning commissions in each of the planning jurisdictions.  They produced a regional plan in 1964 that would have promoted wide scale economic development and transportation improvements throughout the region.  

b) A water quality study produced by LTAC combined with sewage spills triggered calls to export all sewage out of the basin and triggered the formation of a Lake Tahoe Joint Study Committee by the CA and NV legislatures.  They recommended the creation of a regional bi-state agency.  While they negotiated the compact, each state created an interim agency.  The compact was created in 1969 and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) was established in 1970, which acts at the direction of a 10 member governing board.

c) There really was very little sense of interdependence until the late 1980s.  Interest groups and the public were polarized when it came to lake issues.  Litigation was common and the states of CA and NV were often at odds.  Similarly, the TRPA and governing board did not have great relationships with the local governments.  The negotiations of the original compact actually reflected this because rather than have one vote, a majority of both state delegations had to vote to deny a project.  Later this was changed in 1980 with the revised compact to have a majority of each state voting to approve a project.  As recently as 2011, the NV legislature actually passed legislation to begin the process of leaving the compact unless a new regional plan was adopted (it provides more flexibility in terms of redevelopment which is important to the casino industry).  They reversed course in 2013 when the regional plan was updated.

d) The big change in this polarized dynamic happened during the 1987 regional plan’s development.  Litigation surrounding the draft plan resulted in a 3-year moratorium that put the brakes on all development, including environmental restoration projects.  It was the first time that all parties realized that there would have to be compromise to move forward.  Fortunately, the TRPA hired a new director who worked to broker compromise and a new consensus building process was initiated with the help of professional facilitators.  This positive experience led to the creation of new collaborations to for a transportation project in NV in the early 1990s.  Meanwhile, the 5-year reviews of the environmental thresholds continue to show declining lake clarity even though little development had occurred.  As a result, there was a growing recognition that restoration efforts combined with redevelopment of areas that were built poorly could simultaneously benefit the local economy, improve transportation, and improve environmental conditions in the basin.  This new sense of interdependence helped form the environmental improvement program (EIP) that has led to substantial improvements throughout the basin.

a) There are highly structured rules for the collaboration that are included in the federal-interstate compacts (1969 and 1980) and the corresponding regional plans adopted in 1971, 1987, and 2012 and the environmental threshold carrying capacities (ETCCs) required by the 1980 and subsequently adopted in 1982.  They are monitored every 5 years and were to be met by 2007 (they currently meet about 60% of them).  

b) The board structure is not particularly inclusive, but there is an advisory planning commission, which was expanded to include four non-local members with the revised compact.  

c) Transparency is relatively high.  The governing board holds regular meetings that are well attended to make major decisions and issue permits.  To the extent that local decisions have been delegated pursuant to MOUs between local governments and the TRPA, those decisions are similarly transparent.  

d) The governing board’s initial membership in 1969 was 10 members with a 3:2 local majority.  A dual majority was required for project denial and during its first 15 months of existence, 99 percent of projects were approved leading to rapid growth in the basin. This led to disappointment by many groups and a fear that the new TRPA would not help protect the lake due to the domination of local interests on the board.  This created the impetus for modifying the compact and developing a new regional plan. The new compact changed to a 14-member board with a 4:3 state majority with a dual majority to approve a project in 1980.  When combined with the strict land use regulations in the 1987 regional plan, the amount of development has been extremely limited.

a) The TRPA’s staff act on behalf of the governing board and are hesitant to act without the board’s direction.  For example, during a hearing on the NV legislation that would start the process to possibly remove itself from the compact, the TRPA director provided no comment on the proposal because there was no direction from the board.  

b) Most of the leadership has been in the powerful collection of well entrenched stakeholder groups who know each other quite well from their interactions in the context of disputes involving the TRPA or in there interactions in other forums.  From the 1960s to the 1980s, these leaders viewed their interests in terms of either winning or losing and in many respects, the battles were high stakes – high dollar economic development projects and a highly sensitive ecological system.  Accordingly, issues were usually viewed in these win-lose terms until the dynamics started to change (see c).

c) By the mid-1980s, the dynamics started to change.  The new TRPA director embarked on a consensus building effort to generate support for the revised regional plan.  These efforts proved successful and were the first time interest groups really embraced the idea of compromise.  A couple of isolated projects that resulted in innovative compromise solutions.  The Tahoe Transportation Coalition and Water Quality Coalition also started working on projects in a collaborative fashion.  These efforts set the stage for a major shift in attitudes in 1995.  The TRPA hired another new director in 1995 that really helped shift the culture of the agency from aggressive regulatory solutions to projects being the fix.  Other leaders from the gaming and environmental interests provided the foundation for creating the EIP that was based around this new philosophy and leveraging federal and state funding for restoration projects that also fostered economic development.

Conflict and divisive votes were common and still occur.  During times of major policy change (compacts, regional plans, and ETCC reports) there are periods of informal and formal negotiation to build support and make the compromises necessary to secure the votes needed for approval.

b) The process of formulating shared outcomes is a critical part of the case.  The governing board adopted the ETCCs in 1982.  Progress towards all 178 standards, which are oriented around 9 goals are the major benchmark used to measure progress – the most important of which are those oriented around lake clarity.  Progress is monitored on a regular basis and then every 5 years a report is produced that reports on the progress being made (1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2015).  Starting in 2011, an independent panel of 15 peer reviewers was used to further validate the report’s judgments.

c) The monitoring process has grown more complex and thorough over the years and been modified slightly based on an improved understanding of the ecologic system but at its core it has remain largely unchanged so that trends can be observed over time.

Progress is monitored on a regular basis and then every 5 years a report is produced that reports on the progress being made (1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2015).  

b) The release of the report every five years gathers great attention and media coverage and stimulates much discussion.  It is also a means of holding the TRPA accountable because the compact is oriented towards achieving the ETCCs.  In other words, if progress is not being made, a new regional plan or new programs are required.

c) The big change in the dynamics was that during the 1980s, there was a general belief among many of the stakeholders and TRPA staff that the adoption of stringent regulation alone would help stall declining lake clarity and address other ETCCs.  Accordingly, the release of the early threshold reviews in 1991 and particularly 1996 were important is changing the general perception that regulation alone would work because lake clarity continued to decline during a period when there was very little development going on.  This triggered a shift towards restoration and redevelopment to fix sources of ongoing problems.  Interesting, more recent threshold reviews seem to show that the rate of decline has slowed considerably, which reinforces the current approach.  The new 2012 regional plan provides a bit more flexibility to allow this redevelopment and encourages compact development with pedestrian and bicycle transportation.  While criticized by environmental groups and currently under litigation the ETCC monitoring process has helped reinforce the sense that these efforts are helping reduce the rate of decline.

They also have developed MOUs with local governments to improve the efficiency of permitting efforts.

b) It is hard to imagine what Lake Tahoe might look like today had the TRPA not been created. The land use regulations are probably the strictest and most innovative anywhere in the U.S.  Yet, they also could not solve the problem.  The current shift towards collaborative redevelopment indicates another example of learning and problem solving.  Questions of legitimacy do remain.  The Sierra Club sued the TRPA and its 2012 regional plan.  NV threatened to withdraw from the compact in 2011.  While it withdrew this threat in 2013, it does indicate that the partnership remains a delicate balance.

c) It is an unusual case in the sense that there is no considerable long-term data for indicators of the nine thresholds.  When viewed over time, progress is being made.  While it may be slower than those in the environmental community want, given the extreme sensitivity and the legacy of poor land development decisions made from the 1950s to 1970s, the improvements are considerable.  It also appears that rate of decline in lake clarity has at least slowed.  While there is some difference of scientific opinion in terms of the current rate of decline, it is no longer declining as fast and the variations due to natural environmental changes (e.g., rainfall/snowfall) make it harder to find the declines.  This is a positive development.  Given the unique nature of the lake and the 700-year residence time, it is unlikely that clarity will improve both so reaching a stable level of clarity and creating conditions for a slow increase in future clarity may be the best possible outcome.

a) While the collaboration was set up to address the comprehensive set of problems affecting the Tampa Bay ecosystem, the focal issues that motivated participation in the effort were nitrogen loading because that helps restore sea grass beds and habitat restoration (primarily mangroves).
  
b) Since the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) was part of the EPA’s National Estuary Program (NEP), the participants had to comply with a set of planning requirements and ultimately had to produce a comprehensive conservation and management plan (CCMP).  The participants, however, were interested in producing more than a plan that would sit on a shelf.  Accordingly, they formulated measurable goals, identified expected outputs, and then engaged in the process of creating an interlocal agreement that was designed to ensure that these goals were met through a set of sustained implementation efforts.

c) The nature of the problem and partnerships focus on the goals in terms of nitrogen reduction and habitat restoration did not change much during the period under observation. In this case, the period of intense data collection ended in about 2004.  While I continue to monitor the case and the agreement and organizational arrangement remain in place and they continue to work on these shared goals and make funding commitments to sustain the organizational arrangement.  They updated the plan in 2006 and 2017 and have expanded the partnership’s membership in 2016 but it remains oriented around the same issues and ambitions.

";4;2;Externally directed by law or authority;2;4;Off;2;3;4;3;3;4;Off;Off;5;Highly confident;"a) Many of the participants had a long history of interactions.  Several studies in the 1970s highlighted the magnitude of the water quality problems affecting the Bay.  In 1983, a special act of the legislature created the Tampa Bay Study Commission.  Their final report recommended the creation of a Bay Management Authority, which would have regulatory authority over the Bay.  While this approach was rejected, a nonregulatory Agency on Bay Management (ABM) was created within the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council (TBRPC).  The ABM continues to provide a valuable forum for sharing information and addressing issues.  The actors also work together to implement the SWIM program administered by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD).  In addition to working together on water quality issues, many of the same actors also had a long history of working together to address water supply issues.  Generally speaking, water supply issues are filled with more conflict than water quality issues.  Therefore, trust is always an issue and there is a preference for spelling out commitments and creating formal agreements.

b) The TBRPC and ABM were the driving force to prepare the nomination package to apply for entry to the EPA’s NEP.  The FDEP and SWFWMD were also supportive.  While some local governments were initially fearful that it might morph into an unwanted regulatory effort, there was also a strong hope that the designation would help secure additional federal funds to address water quality issues.  After some lobbying and politicking, they became a member of the NEP.  They decided from the onset to create the program as a partnership consisting of six local governments and three regulatory agencies.  This formed the nucleus of the policy committee, which is the main decision making body.

c) There was a strong recognition of their interdependence.  It was clear from their prior interactions that cleaning up the Bay’s water quality was going to require investments of all parties.  There was also a strong incentive to make water quality improvements because the Bay is central to their regional identity and a clean Bay advances tourism, economic development, and the quality of life for their residents.  By the time the collaboration gets started, the actors had already made substantial investments in sewage treatment plant upgrades and it became clear that addressing the nutrients from nonpoint sources was going to be much more difficult.  

d) As participants learned more about the interconnectedness of the issues, this sense of interdependence grew.  For example, all of the counties have to monitor water quality but by collaborating, they could reduce the expense while producing better results.  It also turned out that they needed to collaborate to make better use of their investments in habitat restoration because it mattered not just where the projects were located, but the different types of mangroves needed to be restored in different ratios.  Accordingly, the sense of interdependence has increased overtime.

a) The ground rules for the collaboration initially were quite clear.  The EPA required the use of consensus decision making. While votes would occasionally be taken to move the process forward, as a matter of practice they made sure that there was unanimous agreement when making decisions.  They were also required to use a formal committee structure that EPA referred to as a management conference.  They formed a 9-member policy committee consisting of six local governments and three state regulatory agencies.  While funding moved through the TBRPC, it was made clear from the onset that the staff worked for the policy committee.  The Management Committee was around 16 consisting of top agency officials.  There was also a technical advisory committee with open membership of more than 200 members, with a core group of 50-60 members.  There was a Citizen Advisory Committee consisting of approximately 30 members (each policy committee member could appoint three members).  The problems that would be the focus of the effort had already be well defined from previous planning efforts.

b) There were more than three counties and three municipalities that drain to the Bay.  Only recently has Pasco County joined the partnership.  Instead of focusing on inclusiveness, they participants were deliberate in trying to focus on creating a core decision-making body.  Interestingly, none of the respondents raised questions or concerns about the level of inclusiveness.  Rather, they continue to view that as a key to its success.  Other forums like the ABM, and the TAC provide the larger forums for discussing issues that are more inclusive.

c) Transparency of the decision process was quite high during both plan development and implementation.  Since the six local government elected officials are very familiar with the requirements of open meeting laws, they tend to follow the same procedures used by local governments in terms of meetings.

d) The biggest change occurred at the end of the planning process.  It was clear that the management conference structure would be ill suited to managing the implementation process.  Moreover, the members of the policy committee feared having the CCMP become yet another planning document that would sit on the shelf.  They considered a variety of possible organizational arrangements and settled on using a state statute that allows for the creation of an interlocal agreement, which does not have the same reporting requirements associated with a nonprofit organization.  This required a prolonged period of negotiation and the use of a skilled facilitator to agree on the parameters for the agreement.  The IA not only commits the partners to formal goals, it includes monitoring provisions and committed the partners to a set of shared funding commitments to sustain the staff needed to manage the TBEP moving forward.

While there continues to be an executive director, that individual really functions as the board’s representative and manages day-to-day operations.  The policy board consists of elected officials and high-level agency officials so they tended to run meetings in a very professional matter with an emphasis on trying to find common ground.  

b) Different members also tended to play different leadership roles – devil’s advocate, facilitator, etc. This distribution of leadership was one of the reasons that respondents believed the effort was relatively conflict free even though on water supply issues things tend to have much more conflict.

c) The TBEP has done a good job in managing the leadership dynamics over time.  There founding executive director was replaced by a long-time staff member and more recently they are actually focusing on leadership succession as one of the issue in their strategic plan because many of the long-time members are beginning to retire.  The staff has also done a good job of educating new policy board members so that they are familiar with the issues.

The staff interacted more frequently with each of the board members.  The management committee also met on a regular (monthly basis).  Decisions were made by consensus with the general rule being unanimity for controversial actions.  While conflict did occur, participants managed to find constructive solutions.  When professional facilitators were needed (e.g., formulating the IA) they contracted with experts to help them reach agreement.

b) See above.

c) Once the IA was signed, the decision rules changed from consensus to a simple majority vote of the board unless otherwise specified in the IA or its by-laws.  That said, members still strive towards consensus.  The frequency of the meetings post plan adoption also reduced.  The policy board is required to meet at least 4 times a year.

However, the adoption of the interlocal agreement requires the members to report on progress towards the goals and to report on their actions.  Thus, there is a built in peer pressure mechanism that lets the partners monitor their progress.  They also report collectively on progress so that they are clear not to call out any one member for their lack of progress. 

b) In many ways, the current executive board is designed to function as an oversight board.  Members make commitments to both fund the TBEP baseline operations but to also work towards their shared goals.  The reporting requirements then serve to hold the membership accountable.  The TAC and CAC also serve on the management board established by the IA.  In effect, these advisory committees serve to hold the policy or executive board accountable for progress towards shared goals. Conversely, the policy board can hold the members of the management board accountable for their efforts.

c) These dynamics have not changed much since the creation of the IA and it functioned in a similar manner during the development of the CCMP.

Individuals are responsible individually for nitrogen reductions whereas progress towards other goals is measured collectively.  

b) The recently adopted a revised IA in 2015 reaffirmed the commitment of the members.  In fact, membership has recently expanded.  

c) While there is still a long way to go in terms of nutrient reductions to restore sea grass to its 1950 levels, there is evidence that the individual and collective efforts made in accordance with the IA have made a difference.

Bacterial contamination that leads to the closure of shellfish beds.  Excessive sedimentation that reduced the volume of the bay and has impacts on recreation and wildlife.  Declining salmon runs due to water temperatures, sedimentation, and alteration of stream habitats.

b) When it joined the EPA’s National Estuary Program (NEP) the collaboration was required to produce a comprehensive conservation and management plan (CCMP) that would lead to actions that would address the goals.  The local officials were particularly interested in producing action so the plan specifies a series of measurable targets for actions (outputs) which should help improve the outcomes.

c) The big change in terms of the challenges/ambitions occurred early in the planning process when the region experienced a devastating flood.  As a result, they added an additional priority issue to the planning effort.  Fortunately, it occurred early enough in the planning process to do some of the research necessary to determine what to do to address the problem.  However, the recommended actions did not directly address environmental problems as prescribed by EPA.  This led to some tension and efforts to refine how the issue was presented in the final plan to satisfy the EPA.  However, leaving it out of the plan would have caused the plan to lose local support if it would not address one of the most pressing issues confronting the local region.

";4;3;Externally directed by law or authority;2;2;Off;3;3;2;3;3;4;Off;Off;2;Highly confident;"
a) A couple of prior collaborative efforts and interactions facilitated the collaboration.  The watershed is also located entirely within one small, rural county in OR, Tillamook County.  As a result, some of the key stakeholders had worked in multiple organizations and some of the individuals knew each other on a personal basis outside of their professional work.  One of these efforts was the county’s participation in 1981 as one of the 21 programs in the USDA’s Rural Clean Water Program (RCWP).  As a result, a significant amount of funding was spent on improving agricultural practices over the next 15 years.  These practices were focused mostly on reducing bacterial loadings and sedimentation from the region’s dairy industry.  In 1984, the county formed the Tillamook Bay Sanitation Committee (TBSC) out of concern that the state health division was not doing enough to address water quality problems.  Many of the participants in these efforts were involved in the subsequent collaboration.

b) Initially, Oregon and Washington had planned to nominate the lower Columbia River when the EPA put out its call for nominations to the NEP in 1991.  However, conflicts between the states delayed this nomination.  State officials then scrambled and worked to put a nomination package together that could be submitted by the Governor.  Given the work of the RCWP and the TBSC, they had much of the information needed and the history of prior efforts made for a strong nomination package but it also took some politicking to help make their case.  Tillamook Bay then joined the NEP in 1993.

c) There appeared to be a strong sense of interdependence between the major stakeholders.  The Dairy industry recognized that it was a contributor to the problem.  The state forest also recognized that there was work to do to minimize their impacts.  Wastewater was also a problem.  It probably also helped that these individuals also literally all lived in close proximity to the watershed and that it was very rural.  It is also relatively isolated geographically from Portland and other urban centers.

d) While I continue to monitor the case, in later years there have been some changes in terms of the organizational structure that appear to have reduced some of the interdependence.  It appears that overtime the agricultural and forestry connection seems to be much weaker than it was in the early stages of CCMP implementation.  Instead, the Tillamook Estuary Partnership (TEP) as its now know seems much more focused on habitat restoration, education, environmental monitoring, and information sharing than on installing BMPs.  However, I do not have much data on this shift or know why that occurred.

";20+;20+;nov-15;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;4;Off;2;3;3;2;Off;5;3;4;4;2;Off;2;Off;Highly confident;"a) As a member of the EPA’s NEP, the Tillamook Bay NEP was required to rely on consensus decision making and utilized an elaborate committee structure called a management conference.  The Policy Committee provided the overall guidance and consisted of nine members from federal and state agencies, the governor’s office, and elected officials from the county and city, soil and water district, and the port as well as the chair of the management committee.  The 20 –member management committee was appointed by the policy committee and had a structured set of representatives from different stakeholder groups.  There was also a technical advisory committee, citizens advisory committee, and a finance strategy advisory committee.

b) Overall, the process was inclusive and many additional opportunities for public input and involvement occurred during the planning process.  The initial implementation arrangement, the Tillamook County Performance Partnership (TCPP) also had over 60 stakeholders represented in the larger committee structure. Once it shifted to a nonprofit organization in 2002, the inclusiveness declined considerably as it shifted to both a larger geographic area and a much smaller board.

c) The transparency of decision-making was relatively clear during the planning and implementation stages.  However, once the organizational arrangement shifted to a nonprofit organization some of the transparency seems to have declined, as did the level of inclusiveness.  

d) There were several changes to the institutional architecture.  Once the planning process neared its conclusion, it was clear that a new organizational arrangement was needed to move the collaboration forward and remain focused on implementation.  They ended up deciding on a performance partnership modeled on an initiative promoted by the Al Gore’s National Partners for Reinventing Government.  The objective was to use the new Tillamook County Performance Partnership (TCPP) to reinvent government by using a series of performance measures included in the CCMP and MOUs were signed with Oregon and ten federal agencies.  The goal was to get all three levels of government to agree on goals and outcomes and then provide some flexibility in project funding.  It also became a way to reinvent the program because it got bad press near the end of the process given the long approval process and the realization that $5 million was spent on science and planning to produce a plan and there was little implementation funds.  In 1988, the TCPP was formed by a resolution of Tillamook County.  It consisted of a 13-member executive board that was a subset of a larger 61-member committee that represented the various government agencies and stakeholder groups.  While an ambitious attempt, the TCPP was replaced in 2002 with the Tillamook Estuary Partnership, which was incorporated as a section 501 (c)3 entity with a 7-9 member board.  The boundary of the partnership expanded to include all of the estuaries and watersheds in the county as well.  It also has an advisory committee consisting of many of the former members of the TCPP but it is unclear how active the advisory committee is.

";Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;4;2;Off;3;4;2;Off;4;4;2;Off;3;Off;3;3;Highly confident;"a) The glue that held the collaboration together through the planning process was a small group of well-respected community leaders including a county commissioner, the head of the Tillamook Creamery Association, the director of the state forest, and a couple of state agency officials that had been working on the issue affecting the bay dating back to the RCWP.  They helped hold the partnership together given a lot of staff turnover, helped forge consensus during the CCMP’s development, and promoted the TCPP idea.  While staff worked for the policy board, the lack of supervision and turnover limited their influence on the process.

b) At other times, leadership was lacking, particularly during the early years of the planning process.  The policy committee was not very active and staff did not get an adequate amount of supervision.  This was problematic because the initial executive director lacked a vision for what they wanted to accomplish beyond a vague notion of producing a plan.  There was also a lot of staff turnover in all of the key positions.  They ended up with three executive directors and two interims before the process concluded.  Thus, there was inconsistent direction in terms of the day-to-day operations and in the end, the program took longer than necessary to produce the plan, which was a source of frustration to the members of the partnership.

c) The changes in leadership track the different organizational forms.  Given the turnover in the executive director position, the policy board has had to exert considerable leadership and different board members helped fill different leadership needs.  While the organizational form changed from the TBNEP to the TCPP, the individuals providing the leadership function did not really change.  The real shift appears to have occurred when the TEP formed with a much smaller board, who elects its own members.  This seems to have corresponded to a move away from the emphasis on performance measurement and installation of BMPs and other projects to a more general focus on education, habitat restoration, and environmental monitoring.

The listing of the salmon as an endangered species probably helped in this regard because it is a strong part of the region’s heritage and demonstrated the importance of taking action.  There was also strong motivation to minimize the impact of future flooding events.  Decision-making was based on consensus, which really did mean getting everyone to agree to the plan.  This required many meetings over a prolonged period.  While time-consuming, the participants generally agreed that it was critical to their success.

b) The process of generating the plans shared objectives was an iterative one.  Early in the process, a small group of ten individuals met to produce what came to be known as the preliminary CCMP, which contained 162 actions.  The following year they held 14 public meetings, to get input, which included about 300 recommended actions.  The CAC then refined this to a list of 24 broadly supported, high priority citizen actions and forwarded it to the management committee for their consideration.  These recommendations and the preliminary CCMP provided the framework for what would become the draft CCMP’s action plans.  Each draft chapter was then prepared multiple times to get the approval of the Management Committee.  Once the draft plan was complete, it was released for public comment and received broad support.

c) With the shift to the TEP, the focus has shifted to preparing annual work plans.  The board is heavily involved and oversees their development.  While the CCMP remains in effect, the TEP is working on a revised CCMP that will guide future work plan development.  I am not familiar with the status of this process or how the collaborative process is currently working.  

";3;5;2;Off;3;5;2;Off;3;4;3;Off;4;4;2;3;4;2;Off;Off;3;3;2;Off;5;4;1;Off;2;4;4;2;3;4;2;2;2;4;2;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Highly confident;"
a) The objectives were first formulated in the preliminary CCMP and then refined during the development of the CCMP.  During the planning process, staff and the individual partners were doing a good job of monitoring the progress towards the objectives contained in the CCMP.  In general, this is due to OR’s strong emphasis on performance measurement during the 1990s.  As a result, agencies were required to report on a regular basis.  The listing of the salmon as an endangered species further emphasized the need to document the actions being taken.  Accordingly, at the time of the CCMPs approval and during the early stages of its implementation there was a big emphasis on monitoring and self-reporting to gauge the progress of CCMP implementation.  The appears to have ceased with the shift to the TEP and a switch in the overall orientation of the program.  Rather than monitoring the actions of the partners, it focuses on implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of restoration projects funded with EPA implementation funds.

b) During the TBNEP and TCPP, the planning process provided many opportunities for participants, elected officials, oversight boards, citizens and the press to hold the partnership accountable.  When released for public comment, the plan really was not opposed despite the fact that it recommended the installation of BMPs on dairy farms throughout the region.  The TCPP also had a structure that represented all of the stakeholder groups and was a creature of county government so it was subject to open meeting requirements.  

c) The shift to TEP also marks a shift in accountability.  As a nonprofit, it is not subject to the same open meeting requirements.  It is required by its by-laws to issue public notices of openings on its board and minutes of the non-confidential aspects of board meetings are to be made public by request.  While advisory committee members are allowed to attend the board meetings, they are not open to the public.  So there is clearly less oversight that in the prior organizational arrangements.

The region is relatively poor so the state and local officials and members of the TCCA have always placed an emphasis on using what little federal funding on projects.  This was the emphasis of the RCWP.  They also had an appreciation for the fact that the region’s water quality and habitat problems were created due to a series of small actions and that fixing them required a long series of similarly small fixes.  However, federal/state grant programs tend to promote what they termed as random acts of environmental kindness.  You can get one project funded in a particular stream or tributary but 100s are needed to really make a difference.  This is why the CCMP contains a series of measurable targets that are designed to sustain action over a period to make a difference.  The focus on the TCPP was to try to work with the funders to get enough flexibility to fund these sustained actions but this never really occurred.  The shift to the Bush administration and the demise of Al Gore’s effort further complicated these efforts.  

b) The main unintended consequence of the shift to the TEP is that the program arguably is not engaged in nothing more than funding random acts of environmental kindness.  The move to a countywide program was so that one part of the county was not given special attention and projects now appear to be spread around to help other estuaries beyond Tillamook Bay.  Ironically, this same logic used by federal/state grant programs inhibits making a sustained effort to address the WQ problems in a particular waterbody.

c) The planning process and early years of CCMP implementation certainly stimulated a wide range of projects that led to environmental improvements.  However, more is clearly needed but funding still remains a large problem.  The TEP also appears to be funding some interesting and innovative projects but at the same time, their monitoring data indicates that there are still some significant water quality, sedimentation, and habitat problems.  The salmon (Oregon Coast Coho) remains endangered.

Most strains are benevolent. But some can cause severe food poisoning to humans, sometimes accompanied by hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), leading to anemia and kidney failure. About 800 EHEC infections are reported to the health authorities in Germany yearly. 

Between May and July 2011, a novel strain affected a total of 3,842 patients in the north of Germany alone (2,987 infected with EHEC and 855 with HUS), causing 53 fatalities. On May 8, 2011, the first patient was officially diagnosed with HUS and with what is now known as the EHEC strain O104. The outbreak spread exponentially. From May 8 on, 10 to 18 new cases per day were registered. From May 19 on, authorities were registering about 140 new EHEC and 60 HUS infections daily. The numbers were stunning. In the intensive care units, it soon became clear that the usual treatments did not affect the new bacterium. In the regions affected, the hospitals quickly ran out of bed capacity, personnel and equipment. The number of patients with both EHEC and HUS reaching its climax on May 21 and 22. 

In early June 2011, experts from the BfR (risk assessment authorities), the BVL (consumer protection authorities), the RKI (medical authorities, the local states and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) convened a Task Force to contain and fight the outbreak. This collaboration emerged on an ad hoc basis. The overall aim of the Task Force was to identify the food source, the new strain (and related therapy), and to develop recommendations regarding future risks. 

The first phase of the work in this task force was mostly technical and data driven and contributed greatly to contain the spread. The focus therefore went from the original goals towards a more political discussion regarding the lack of coordination between local, states and federal levels, as well as a lack of coordination between functions in the organization of the State. The work of the taskforce became the object of a best-practice scrutiny and moved towards becoming a piece of regulation involving the governments of all 16 states of Germany. 

";2;4;Self-initiated by participants;4;4;Off;5;5;4;4;5;5;Off;Off;5;Highly confident;"At the regional level, each of the16 German federal states has agencies that deal with the same issues as the federal ministries. Federal agencies only serve as facilitators of coordination and have no mandate to deal and interfere with regional affairs. They are, however, the coordinating platform for data and information that concerns more than one state. Hence, there is very little collaboration on the regional level. What is more, medical services and consumer protection services were not used to work jointly. Consequently, all participants first relied on their own procedures forwarding data and samples to the state and federal authorities, thereby provoking important delays in crisis response (for example, medical doctors to the local and state health authorities used to fax the notification requirement for people infected by EHEC. It could take up to two weeks for this data to reach the federal level). Similarly, the hospitals involved reported on the fastidious nature of equipment and personnel exchange in normal times. Medical practitioners at this level, however, could rely on newsletters and mailing lists to channel their problems and demands beside the formal procedures. 

Against the backdrop of the crisis, all participants quickly became strongly aware of their interdependence, because each needed information they did not have about fields they did not know. Risk assessment, food safety and medical authorities did not build on a history of collaboration, and never had faced such an urgent situation. A case in point: food safety was using different data formats than the medical authorities, rendering cross analysis impossible. What is more, the blatant uncertainty in the first weeks, aggravated by intense media scrutiny, pushed politicians and executive officials to issue statements they would withdraw later on. In particular, health authorities in the city-state of Hamburg claimed the source might be organic cucumbers from Spain. This information turned out to be wrong, but was enough at that point in time for the German authorities to warn against consuming this product. This announcement had repercussions in the whole European market and beyond - some countries even banned cucumber imports temporarily. 

The setting up of a taskforce helped the authorities to coordinate information in and out and to reduce the reigning cacophony. Despite the ad-hoc nature of the collaboration across authorities, trust emerged nonetheless based on expertise and data needs, and driven by the urgency to act. In retrospect, the taskforce also contributed to shift the media attention onto a single, clearly identified team of actors imbued with technical legitimacy. Similarly, the work performed in such proximity to each other helped creating new data formats to cross analyze data collected by various authorities, in this case on food traceability and epidemiology. A respondent claimed that the culture seemed to have changed after that. That members of the authorities involved were more likely to use the phone and talk directly than to rely only on the administrative channels.

Against this background, collaborating was, as such, an innovation. Ground rules of collaboration were, to the best of my knowledge not clearly defined beyond clear assignments based on each participant's mandates, jurisdiction and skills. The taskforce would gather in meetings during which tasks and priorities were discussed. All in all, the process seemed to be particularly deferent to expertise, a typical characteristic of systems that strive for high reliability. The taskforce, however, performed the role of coordinator, not least of data, and fed back their results and further inquiries to agencies at the state levels. In particular, With the help of the EFSA, they developed software that would help computing the multiple data format at hand. I have no data to report on the concrete decision-making processes and received mixed information from participants, each trying to pull the leadership onto themselves, in retrospect. Overtime, however, it seems that the taskforce developed processes that were effective enough for all participants to fulfill their share and collectively contain and manage the crisis. ;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;3;5;Off;2;3;5;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;2;Off;5;4;Mostly confident;"Leadership was centralized around three central, federal level agencies. In the task force as such, the three agencies seem to have worked along the mode of shared governance. As federal agencies, however, their job was solely to recommend actions and provide information to the local authorities and respective state governments, not to enforce these suggestions. 

The three central lead organizations quite naturally enforced their position through the expertise and data they possessed. This centralized leadership remained unchallenged during the collaboration and was instrumental in running all necessary analysis, including developing a set of technical tools (software and data formats), under extreme time pressure. 

Towards the end, however, voices emerged to criticize the distant approach of federal agencies, who would drop the pen Friday afternoon, unconcerned with the operational consequences of the work at the local level. Upon termination of the crisis, the central agencies remained vocal in the press to maintain the momentum and institutionalize the taskforce as instrument for crisis management.

Data collected by the medical authorities, however, seemed to suggest a profile of patients that did not match meat consumption and instead pointed at salad. After the cucumber incident, the RKI (federal medical agency) advised against eating raw vegetables for the meantime. 

The Task Force held its first meeting on June 3, 2011. Using epidemiological data from the RKI, the task force identified geographical outbreak clusters and collected relevant information with regards to the cluster. The group, however, was still searching for a reliable technique to identify the carrier of the disease. The solution came from a suggestion from one of the members, who had heard of a similar problem in the U.S., where a former cook had poisoned guests in the restaurant that had just fired him. The RKI initiated a recipe-based restaurant study. One cluster of patients had all dined in the same restaurant and contracted the disease afterwards. Cooks were interviewed and the investigators collected recipes, invoices and order books of the respective restaurant, as well as photos of the meals prepared by the cooks to show to patients. 

The advantage of this new study method was its independence from patients’ memory regarding the consumption of meals and food in days long gone. As a result of this study, the focus shifted towards fenugreek sprouts as the potential cause of the outbreak. On June 10, another meeting of the Task Force took place to discuss the results of the recipe-based restaurant cohort study. The ingredient shared by all patients and the food they had ordered were organic fenugreek sprouts. Using data from the BVL (consumer protection), the task force could identify the producer and shipping routes of the sprouts.  

While the task force concentrated on its work, hospitals organized the pooling of capacity across the country using mailing lists from newsletters medical doctors used for scientific purposes. A potential cure was presented by a pharmaceutical company. Using the crisis as leeway, patients hospitals ran tests with the new drug on voluntary patients, which proved effective. 

Upon termination of the crisis, the taskforce disbanded. After having worked for so long with such urgency, all participating agencies went back to business as usual, starting with sending their employees off for vacations and catching up with other issues that had been put on hold during the crisis. Until the next crisis, joint fact-finding went on stand-by, and so did the exchange of knowledge. But the central agencies remained vocal in the press to maintain the momentum and institutionalize the taskforce as instrument for crisis management. A few weeks later, a new case of foodborne disease outbreak hit kindergartens in Berlin. Although the case was fairly straightforward (the ingredient, strawberry, quickly came out and was not easy to forget for patients), the authorities quickly activated the taskforce again, as a way to enforce its usefulness.

Due to the high levels of uncertainty, the goals took clearer shape as the task force made progress towards containment. Their progress, however, were closely monitored by the press, to the extent that informing all officials who were not involved in the task force as such, but needed to talk to journalists, had to be briefed constantly.

In addition, citizens' concerns about the situation kept growing, especially as it became clear that coordination was being invented on the spot. NGOs active in the food business contributed to induce even more uncertainty to the debate by shedding light on practices in the food trade and dangers related with food consumption

 All in all, the pressure around the participants in the task force came from the issue-based field that had formed around the outbreak. We can safely assume that political pressure was being exerted by the federal ministries on their respective agencies. This pressure was particularly strong at the beginning of the collaboration, and kept on growing in the subsequent weeks until crisis containment.

Identifying the carrier of the disease contributed greatly to reducing uncertainty and take some of the pressure off of the agencies' shoulders. In the last months of observations, the pressure took a different direction as the agencies could demonstrate success with the newly minted structure, and make a case for a new piece of regulation.

In the autumn of 2012, the experience gained during the EHEC case was put to good
use in a case of infected strawberries fed to children in Berlin schools. Although this case did not cause any fatalities and was easier to define (only one company was delivering the food), the
organizations quickly drew on the task force as an interorganizational tool to determine
the skills and knowledge needed for the job, the actors who would be responsible, and a
joint action plan and hypotheses to work on. Thus, the task force is considered a valuable
device for organizing work on an ad hoc basis, and obviating the need to create new, overarching
bureaucracies or establishing a centralized form of governance in the hands of one
administration. Although one organization is in charge of making the first phone calls,
this responsibility does not take the form of a governance role. 

On September 14 to 16, 2011, the conference of state consumer protection ministries decided to launch a process of regulation to capture the learning that had taken place during the outbreak into a piece of regulation that would formalize the task force and its processes. The regulation defines the notion of crisis, the constitution of a crisis council with representatives from all concerned state and federal authorities responsible for setting up task forces when necessary, the constitution of a food emergency unit with its own managing body, the statuses of the task force, as well as guidelines for crisis communication. The bill was signed by all respective state ministries between the years 2012 and 2013 and published August 31, 2013, two years after the crisis. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using technology to remove geographic barriers, participants with a collective vision share ideas, best practices, and lessons learned, and track their progress toward similar benchmarks and shared goals. CoIIN provides a way for participants to self-organize, forge partnerships, and take coordinated action to address complex issues through structured collaborative learning, quality improvement, and innovative activities. 

Each successful CoIIN does the following:

Works together to identify common aims and specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-specific objectives to clearly describe what they are setting out to achieve;
Identifies and utilizes evidence-based strategies to show how these objective will be accomplished; and
Uses clear-cut metrics and shares real-time data to show what’s working and determine if the aim was achieved. 
IM-CoIIN is a multiyear national movement engaging federal, state and local leaders, public and private agencies, professionals, and communities to employ quality improvement, innovation and collaborative learning to reduce infant mortality and improve birth outcomes. Infant Mortality CoIIN has identified six strategic areas to focus on:
- SIDS/SUID/Safe Sleep: Improve safe sleep practices
- Smoking Cessation: Reduce smoking before, during and/or after pregnancy
- Preconception/Interconception Health: Promote healthy birth spacing and reduce unintended pregnancy
- Social Determinants of Health: Incorporate evidence-based policies/programs and place-based strategies to improve social determinants of health and equity in birth outcomes
- Prevention of Preterm and Early Term Births: Increase appropriate use of 17 OH progesterone, a hormone given to prevent pre-term labor, and/or reduce early elective deliveries (i.e., before 40 weeks gestation)

Collaborative Innovation Networks COINs:
Different types of collaboration are categorized through their networking structure in extension of the “diffusion of innovation model” of Everett Rogers .  The network structure is measured by doing survey-based SNA or by mining communication archives of organizations. COINs are cyberteams of intrinsically motivated innovators embedded into a three-tier structure of 
1. COIN (Collaborative Innovation Network) the initial core team of 5 to 15
2. CLN (Collaborative Learning Network), the 150+ friends & family prototyping the original idea of the COIN
3. CIN (Collaborative Interest Network), the 1500+ early adapters of the innovation developed by COIN and CLN.

Societal challenges and organizational issues

In the city of Eindhoven (Netherlands), Stratumseind is one of the most important nightlife areas. It is the longest ‘pub’ street of the Netherlands where you can find over 50 pubs, café’s, discotheques and restaurants located in one street. It is well known for many years now, but the last couple of years this street faces some challenges that have to be met. Not just with regard to safety, but also with regard to cooperation and economic viability.

b. Ambitions and desired outputs and outcomes

There were three ambitions:

(1) Collecting facts and knowledge about different aspects that (possible) have to do with the liveability, safety and attractiveness of the street. With specific measuring equipment anonymous data are collected about the visitors of the street, the surroundings and the local circumstances.
(2) Offering a platform for (scientific) research. The street becomes a testing ground for scientific
research that looks at the influence of light on the behaviour of people. The expectation is that the intensity and perhaps also the colour of the light used in public spaces will have a positive effect on the possible aggressive behaviour of people in a street.
(3) Creating an environment that gives a boost to innovation. This innovation is needed to reach the goals of liveability, safety and attractiveness of the street. Partners of the LLS (entrepreneurs) that have an idea about the way to increase the liveability, safety or attractiveness of Stratumseind can test products, equipment, concepts and ideas in real life practice.

c. How these challenges, issues and ambitions evolved during the period observed.

In the early period there was a focus mainly on technological value (making the technology work) and symbolic values (highlighting the unique character of this living lab). Some more attention for the value of the technology for actually tackling societal problems rose later on but there was still a strong focus on technology as such rather than on its value for improving the liveability, safety and attractiveness of the street
";2;4;Self-initiated by participants;2;2;Off;4;4;2;3;4;4;Off;Off;4;Mostly confident;"(a) Prehistory and past interactions of participants

All the key actors that initiated the collaboration - Philips, City of Eindhoven, Technological University of Eindhoven - have a strong connection with the city. They have been working together in the establishment of Brainport Eindhoven which is a major and successful triple collaboration. The participants in the Living Lab Stratumseind built upon this history of triple helix collaboration.

(b) How the collaboration was initiated

The collaboration started from two sides:

1. The City of Eindhoven started a project - Stratumseind 2.0 - to upgrade this street
2. The Technological University of Eindhoven started a research project - De-escalate - on the effects of light on behavior in public spaces. They collaborated with Philips in this project.

These two initiatives converged in the idea of setting up a living lab for experimenting with new technologies: the Living Lab Stratumseind.

(c) Sense of interdependence between participants and the incentives to collaborate

There was a strong sense of interdependence between the three key actors: the city felt they needed and innovative approach, the university needed a test bed for its research and Philips wanted to develop a business case for its technology. Interestingly, the citizens and owners of bars in the street only played a secondary role in the collaboration.

(d) Any significant changes over time in the period observed

The role of the owners of bars and citizens increased somewhat over time: the Living Lab Stratumseind helped to engage owners of bars of citizens in the search for improvements. Interestingly, these groups had limited interest in high tech solutions and had a stronger focus on simple and concrete measures (such as, for example, cleaning the street at a reasonable time of the night).";1-mei;16-20;16-20;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;1;Off;2;1;1;1;Off;2;3;4;3;4;Off;3;Off;Mostly confident;"(a) Ground rules of the collaboration

The rules for the collaboration were largely implicit and there were no formal rules. Informal rules applied to the separate actors (e.g. rules about democratic control for government actors, rules for valid knowledge production for academic actors and rules about ownership of technology for private actors) but this did not result in shared rules for the living lab. Later on in the process, this resulted in some tensions, especially concerning questions about the ownership of the technologies that were developed and tested in the living lab.

(b) Inclusiveness of the collaborative forum(s)

The collaborative form focus mostly on the inclusion of government, academic partners and technology procedures. There were contacts with citizens and bar owners but these were not even acknowledged as stakeholders in the official documents. More attention for these groups developed in the process but their engagement in the developments of technologies in the living lab remained limited.

(c) Transparency of decision making within the collaborative forum(s)

The transparency of the decision-making process is mostly limited. There was indeed explicit attention for privacy aspects and these were clearly communicated, also to the city parliament. The plans for the living lab were also presented in policy documents. However, other aspects of decisions such as choices for certain technological options or focus on issues were taken informally and not clearly communicated to the outside world. The living lab was mostly regarded as a learning environment and learning occurred mostly between the actors involved in the lab.

(d) Significant changes in the institutional architecture of collaboration over time

No significant changes occurred in the living lab collaboration in the period that we studied it.";Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;3;3;Off;2;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;4;Off;4;4;Mostly confident;"(a) Form and style of leadership within the collaboration

Leadership occurred at several different levels in the collaboration. At the political level, the mayor of Eindhoven played a key role in pushing for improvements at Stratumseind. He played a key role in bringing the various stakeholders to collaborate. At the research level, the main researcher from the Eindhoven University of Technology brought together governmental and business partners in a form of triple helix collaboration. At the operational level, a civil servant from the city played a key role in setting up the living lab and bringing all kinds of stakeholders to the living lab and facilitate their collaboration.

(b) Dynamics and impact of leadership on the collaborative process
The political leadership played a key role in the beginning to bring stakeholders into the project and its role declined later on in the process. The research leadership also played a role in the beginning and became less important once the leadership was established. The operational leadership became more important throughout the project as operational issues became more important. The operational leadership played a key role in bringing new technological partners into the project.

(c) Changes in the leadership dynamics in the period observed

As indicated above, leadership at the operational level became more important and political and research leadership became less prominent.";4;3;3;Off;5;5;5;Off;2;2;2;Off;4;4;4;Off;3;2;4;Off;4;3;4;3;4;Off;Off;2;4;3;4;Off;Mostly confident;"(a) Collaborative process in terms of how the actors interacted with each other

The specific focus of the Living Lab Stratumseind and the fact that they had their own room with screens and information contributed to the interactions. At the same time, the actors all had their own focus and this did not help to bring them together on a frequent basis.

(b) How they formulated and achieve shared outcomes

The desired outcomes were quite different. They started with the notion that they could collaborate in a living lab but the ambition of the key actors were quite different. Local government wanted to improve the reputation of the street, the university wanted to develop knowledge about the effects of light technology in public space and the tech companies wanted to test technologies and develop business cases. The citizens and bar owners wanted concrete improvements such as less noise and better sales of beer. 

(c) How the process changed over the period observed

In the beginning, there seemed to be more confidence in the overlap of these objectives. Over time, the different interests resulted in some frictions.";2;2;2;Off;2;2;2;Off;2;2;2;Off;4;2;2;4;2;2;Off;Off;1;1;1;Off;2;2;2;Off;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;2;2;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"(a) how the goals of the collaboration were formulated and monitored

Very general goals were formulated at the start for the overall project Stratumseind 2.0. The basic goals were to establish a 'basecamp' (also referred to as ‘board computer’ or as ‘measuring station’) and an ‘engine block’ (initiator for renewal and innovations in the area). These broad ideas highlight that the living lab can stimulate innovation by measuring activities and stimulating innovation. At the same time, these objectives provided broad ideas but no specific targets or indicators.

(b) how participants, elected officials, oversight bodies, and citizens held the collaboration to account

The accountability mostly focused on privacy. An independent assessment of the privacy implications was conducted and information was provided to elected officials. Oversight bodies and citizens could also obtain this information. The accountability for this aspect seemed to be well organized but, at the same time, all other aspects were broadly neglected. No political or public debate about the desirability of the living lab took place.

(c) how these dynamics changed over the period observed

Nationally there was some intention for the living lab and the question was raised whether this was desirable. In the city itself, there was hardly any debate about the desirability of the living lab and the innovation that were realized.";4;2;2;Off;1;1;1;Off;5;5;5;Off;1;1;1;Off;2;2;2;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;3;3;3;Off;1;1;1;Off;generate a positive image of the area;5;5;5;Off;5;5;5;4;4;4;3;3;3;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;5;1;1;1;4;4;4;Off;Off;Off;4;4;4;4;4;4;5;5;5;1;Off;1;1;Off;Off;;5;5;4;4;4;4;3;3;3;1;1;1;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"(a) the output of the collaboration in terms of results produced by the collaborative governance process

The collaboration was highly successful in producing (1) technological innovations and (2) boosting the image of the street. The living lab helped to realize working applications of a host of new technologies such as smart streetlights, data dashboards, etc. These technologies were hardly debated and broadly seen as valuable ways to improve the street. In addition, the street changed its image from being a rowdy street with frequent problems to being a high-tech lab that showcased the innovative solutions that the city was developing for urban safety and livability. At the same time, the living lab was much less successful in an instrumental sense: there were no clear indications that the use of new technologies had actually helped to improve the street's afety and livability. 

(b) the outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences

The outcomes were broadly seen as legitimate. As researchers, we raised many questions about the desirability of such as high-tech, quantified street but stakeholders broadly accepted these solutions. At the same time, the outcomes were much less convincing in terms of problem solving. The broad problems of safety and livability were hardly tackled by the technologies. At the same time, the technological objectives of creating a 'basecamp' and an 'engine block' (see question 54) were realized.

(c) the changes to collective outputs and social outcomes over time

The argument was that technological successes would in time result in instrumental improvements. In the period we investigated the case, however, we found no support for this expectation.

In this project, my study focus was its four-year collaboration-intensive exploration phase finelised n 2020. During this phase, various governmental and non-governmental actors and organizations worked jointly to explore and identify opportunities for linking flood safety  with environmental objectives and spatial solutions on and around the dike.
 Although the dike stretch is short, it is one of the most strategically important dikes in the country in terms of its impact on the hinterland. A dike breach may affect an extensive area with water levels reaching up to 3m and causing more than €10 billion of economic damage . Moreover, the extraction of clay from local floodplains resulted in new riverine nature and wetlands, which are now key nature conservation areas in the Netherlands under the European Natura 2000 policies. Consequently, any intervention in the area, including improvement of flood protection infrastructure, follows the logic of building within nature, that is integrating the new infrastructure into the environment. 
b. Since the Grebbedijk does not meet the new safety standards adopted in the Netherlands, it needs to be reinforced almost over the entire length. For this reason, the project was initiated in 2016. Next to the main goal of delivering flood safety, participating authorities together with the residents and interested parties have set an intention of exploring synergies and smart combinations of Grebbedijk’s main goal with additional ambitions in the scope of nature, recreation, spatial quality and sustainability.
c. I constructed a chronology of key events and decisions leading to the final plan for Grebbedijk's reinforcement: 
1.Developing six possible alternatives (start stage: begin. 2016  - begin. 2018) - during this stage there was a wide range of possible options, objectives, ambitions discussed. These ideas were then integrated into five building block reports on water safety, nature, infrastructure and economy, recreation and landscape and sustainability.  Based on these building blocks, six spatially coherent combinations of water safety with additional functions have been developed by collaborative parties (in consultation with concerned stakeholders). 
2. Optimizing six possible alternatives into three promising alternatives (assessment stage: begin. 2018 – mid. 2019) - extensive assessments (environmental impact assessment (EIA), cost effectiveness analysis, technical studies etc.) of technical and administrative visibility of all  six possible solutions, including for optimal mix of functions, were carried out.  Although it was potentially foreseen that number of building blocks could be dropped out, this did not happen in practice. Instead of choosing three options out of six, a conscious choice was made to incorporate and integrate all six possible options into new three alternatives
3. Adopting the preferred alternative- the plan (final decision stage: mid. 2019- mid. 2020). 15 out of 20 proposed addition functions were coupled with flood safety objective and may be considered as an integrative plan.
";4;2;Externally directed by law or authority;3;3;Off;5;4;3;4;2;4;Off;Off;4;Mostly confident;"a. Since this was a multi-level (central government, provinces, municipalities), multi-sector collaboration, it is hard to judge about prehistory or past interactions of participants other than they  existed under different initiatives. However,  some of my interviewees  mentioned the prehistory of conflicts among some of the collaborating parties. For example,  some highlighted the long standing organizational competitiveness and even conflicts between the Gelderland province, the municipality of Wageningen or Vallei en Veluwe water authority  (e.g. an ongoing tension over a new road construction in the city). Competitiveness arises also over the ownership of collaborative effort when two large regional public authorities, the province and water authority, struggle to share the leading role in the project. Such tensions affect to some extent the  organizational and personal relationships in collaborative arrangements, but I did not find any evidence that within the Grebbedijk this was an issue, largely because the project manager was able to deal with most of conflicts before they would become an issue.
b. This is a governmentally mandated collaboration. A new policy was adopted: the new safety standards in the Netherlands, and large number of projects were set up in order to implement this policy. Grebbedijk was one of them.
c. There was a high sense of interdependency, as the water authority saw the opportunity for creating synergies with other parties, which was in fact the main incentive to collaborate for almost all involved.
d. At the beginning the expectations were very high. The parties were convinced that many, if not all additional ambitions would be granted in the final plan. However, during the assessment stage it became clear not everything is technically visible, or it was too expensive and the proposing party would have insufficient budget for that coupling option, or there would be regulatory obstacles (e.g. nature protection area). This is the reason why towards the last stage of exploration phase some parties were less engaged (but still formally involved) in the processes knowing their goals would not be accomplished as they would have expected that.

As it is with governmentally  mandated collaborations/projects of Dutch flood protection program, most of the procedural arrangements were designed for producing a joint plan. For dike reinforcement projects, Dutch flood protection program follows general guidelines on phasing infrastructure projects into (pre)exploration, plan elaboration and implementation. Although the implementation logic of Grebbedijk was pre-determined, the project team together with collaborating parties had the flexibility to develop a detailed Action Plan on how exactly to execute the exploration phase. The Action Plan as a central procedural document outlines the scope of  project membership, objectives and responsibilities of those involved,  communication and participation strategies, description of the steps within the exploration phase, including project management and decision-making procedures. It was developed in consultation with and approved by the authorities. 
b. My interview and survey data suggests that this collaboration was highly inclusive. 
Through social media, local news channels and the official webpage of the project with a sign-up option anybody interested  was invited to contribute ideas about the future look of the dike and the surrounding area. A collaborative platform called Dijkdenkers (dike thinkers in English) was launched for the stakeholders. Over 150 interested people from the area (residents, private companies, farmers, nature organizations and water sports associations) participated in several workshops and sessions. Also there was an overall agreement that formal decision-making parties of the collaboration included all those who would potentially have a concern or interest with the design and implementation of Grebbedijk project.
c. Judging from the survey data, the decision-making process of Grebbedijk was fairly transparent. There were two questions regarding this:
1- To what extent do you agree that the decision-making process in Grebbedijk  is characterized by a high degree of transparency? 10 out 12 respondents answered they fully or mostly agree with this statement.
2 Do you think the development of Grebbedijk's preferred alternative (the Plan) was a transparent process? (binary question) 11 out of 12 answered  YES .
d. No major changes could be observed. Only most of the efforts at the beginning of the collaboration went into setting-up/ arranging the ground rules, while leaving room for adapting these rules slightly later in the process.";Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;4;5;5;Off;4;5;5;Off;3;4;3;Off;5;Off;5;4;Highly confident;"a. The leadership  was also predetermined in the Grebbedijk through the role of project manager. The water authority (as lead actor) anticipating the complexity of interests, strategically recruited a professional having experience in spatial and environmental planning as opposed to many Dutch flood protection program's projects led by civil engineers. 
b. The role of the project manager in connecting parties, mediating risks or conflicts as well as steering the process towards  integrative final plan was decisive. His skillset as well as connective capacity was traced in the meeting minutes and interview data. Furthermore, he was responsive to adapt to contextual dynamics of the project.  It was his recommendation to pass on one of his responsibilities and appoint an independent  chair for the stakeholder platform in order to avoid conflict of interests. The decision was also circumstantial  as after synthesizing stakeholder’s insights and prospection about the future of the dike, facilitating further knowledge development for transitioning towards the project’s assessment stage was prioritized. 
c. Towards the end of observed period, there was a transition of leadership from one project manager to the other, indicating the capacity of collaboration to adapt to contextual dynamics of the project. It is common in the Netherlands, to employ managers with certain qualifications depending on the phase of the project (e.g. a planner for exploration phase, and engineer for plan elaboration phase). Eventually, the new project manager assembled the collaborative efforts of the exploration phase and brought the project to the follow up phase: planning.";5;4;3;Off;3;3;4;Off;4;5;3;Off;5;5;4;Off;5;4;4;Off;4;5;3;5;5;Off;Off;3;2;5;5;Off;Highly confident;"a. The collaborative process was very productive in terms of providing sufficient opportunities for the parties to interact with each other and identify shared interests and form corresponding interest groups (e.g. environmental, water sports, recreation). At least 12 types of gatherings (e.g. information evenings, design workshops, Dijkdenker’s meetings, kitchen-table meetings,thematic building block sessions etc.) for participants to raise their individual, organizational and shared interests concerning the Plan were counted. The meetings stimulated dialog on clarification of shared meanings and concepts of common interest: “integrality” as describing the boundaries of area development and integration of various area ambitions or “ambition” illustrating the interests participants bring to the project and their willingness contribute financially. Similarly, other concepts that would concern the joint efforts of participants (e.g. sustainability, circularity, area development) were discussed and clarified. The actors were also able to come up with intermediate agreements on joint development of the preferred alternative. This highlights the consensus on generating an integrative/ shared output (plan).
b. The main output of collaboration, the preferred alternative (Plan) has been formulated through so called funneling procedure (basis for defining the stages of collaboration in my study) involving all the actors (starting with number of options, working out those, assessing visibilities, cutting down the number of possible options, and choosing the most optimal one at the end).
c. Nearing the end of the exploration phase and finalization of the Plan, the intensity of collaborative process diminished.  The diversity of group meetings declined. 6 out of 12 types of meetings were maintained with decreased frequency. Most of the individual consultations with all actors intensified during the assessment stage were now conducted with the authorities only. The main purpose of these consultations was to “fine tune” the details (e.g. financial) of the Plan. Consequently, deliberation mechanisms employed in the previous stages (e.g.  thematic working groups) were largely not necessary as the group meetings had an objective of presenting the draft Plan to the audiences. Overall, the efforts of earlier stages paid off and the draft Plan was approved at last. Moreover, the declined intensity of collaborative process suggests that the draft Plan was not overly contested while the offered mechanisms of engagement and deliberation could be largely used.  ";4;5;5;Off;4;5;5;Off;4;5;5;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;5;5;5;Off;4;4;4;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;5;4;4;3;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"The major goal of collaboration,that is to ensure flood safety, was determined in accordance with the policy of new flood safety standards in the Netherlands. 
The policy and legal frameworks for new flood safety standards in the Netherlands point out also the necessity of cross-sector collaboration between flood safety, spatial planning and/or other sectors in achieving the desired level of protection. Where possible, the government facilitates integrated area development comprising of a range of environmental and spatial functions. Therefore, for the collaboration of Grebbedijk project the goal was to deliver flood safety  that also links and integrates with other socio-economic, spatial and environmental functions.
The monitoring was conducted by the project initiator and lead actor: the Vallei en Veluwe water authority. 
The collaboration was primarily accountable to the management of the Vallei en Veluwe water authority and Dutch flood protection program (setting ordinary project management deadlines, deliverables, decision making rules).";3;5;5;Off;1;1;4;Off;4;5;5;Off;3;4;5;Off;3;4;Off;5;Off;5;5;3;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;1;1;4;3;3;4;3;3;1;1;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;4;5;4;4;3;3;3;4;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;3;4;4;4;4;3;1;Off;2;2;Off;Off;Off;5;5;5;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;4;3;Off;5;4;3;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"a. The major output of Grebbedijk collaboration (importantly the exploration phase of this project) was its preferred alternative: the plan on how the reinforcement of the dike should be executed. The plan addressed the project's goal of assuring water safety and additionally incorporating 15 out of 20 additional ambitions (e.g. offering extra space for pedestrians and cyclists through the stepped profile of the dike, constructing small lake/pond for recreational use, building basic facilities for the future use of thermal energy from surface water, restoring the cultural-historical monument ""Hoornwerk"" etc.  ) proposed by the parties. 
b. Since the plan has not been implemented yet, it is difficult to judge about the impacts. It is anticipated that the technical solution arranged with this plan will ensure flood safety and the people (residents living behind the dike) affected directly by the reinforcement/reconstruction works are mostly happy with the solution. However, with many other expected impacts (improved spatial quality, enhanced environmental conditions, recreational opportunities etc.) expectations are less clear. When the project is finalized in couple of years, it is more reasonable to observe and measure the impacts.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The central infrastructures were the electricity grid and RES. The grid had been privatised and its opperator (Vattenfall) had no ambitions for such a transition. In 2014 a window of opportunity opened as the 20 year contract to operate the grid expired and could be terminated by the city senate. Energy prices were regarded as unjust and too high.  Control and ownership by the city senate was mistrusted as it had privatised before. The Senate and administration were reluctant to obey to popular opinion and enforce a post carbon transition..The coalition had to build enough pressure in the city society to enforce a referendum and win it.
 
b) The aim was to move the senate to terminate the contract and take the grid back into public ownership. Secondly, the grid should have been a stepping stone to massive public investments in RES to power it with 100%  green energy. Thirdly, social justice and democratic control were not means to create legitimacy but ends in themselves. Control of the grid-and-production-utility should have been democratised by direct vote and worker participation. 

c) In the start of the period observed (2010 - 2011) app. 50 grass root initiatives united in one super structure, the BET (Berliner Energietisch). They had to agree on internal rules to discuss, moderate, decide and speak in public. They succeeded. In the middle of the p.o. (2011 - 2013) BET had to mobilise thousands of volunteers to collect signatures twice. This was a success..BET had to press the incumbent actors (governemnt) for a favourable agenda setting (date of the vote). This failed. BET had to convince the popular opinion in the city for its case and did so. It had to mobilise 25% of the electorate to go vote and failed narrowly (24%). In the end of the p.o. (2014 - 2021) BET had only a minor role as observer. The government coopted the project..It established a new actor (Berlin Energie) that became the agent of change though with lower ambitions. After a change in government and long court cases BE reached one aim of BET in 2021 in grid re-municipalisation. A second goal, the new green city owned utility was realised too but in a much smaller fashion than desired. The radically democratic element (direct vote of board) and justice element (price policy) where scraped. Public opinion turned widely against privatisation and embraced re-municipalisations. 
";4;4;Self-initiated by participants;2;3;Off;1;1;1;3;5;5;Off;Off;2;Mostly confident;"a) Already at the end of 2010, attac Berlin, BürgerBegehren Klimaschutz and PowerShift came together to discuss the possibility of the city of Berlin taking over the Berlin power grid..They shared a history of colaborating in two very similar but smaller projects: the popular vote on the S-Bahn (local train transport) 2011, public vote to disclose the secret water contracts that resulted in a success, the re-municipalising of public Water (2004 - 2012). The latter (water) was the first success of a popular vote that forced the city governemnt to re-municipalise. 
Attac had a leadership in the water campaign and carried then on to energy with similar people. Continuity of people (mostly volunteers) was greater than that of organisations and names. 
b) By 3 non profit Berlin based actors or branches: Attac, BürgerBegehren Klimaschutz and PowerShift. In a second step by a one weekend long workshop, in a third step by 12 plenary sessions (10/2011 – 01/2012). 
c) Initiators and those that joined later had a common sense of a joint struggle against a monopolist, parts of the governemnt and parts of the local press (David against Goliath). The notion was that only joined forces had a chance. There was a clear sense that climate and energy were public goods worth ""fighting"" for. (that language was used) Volunteers had rather an ecological than a social-justice motivation. 
d) The coalition grew from 3 to app. 50 groups in 2 years. It united a centrist-left labour union, large NGOs and post-communist and radical green groups. It collected donations to fund paid for positions. The alliance reduced its activity after the depressing and narrow defeat in the 10/2013 vote. It then functioned as an observer and well visible critique of the government run institution (BE) that aimed to re-municipalise the grid. BE as a government institutoin was adjacent to BET ´s bottom up culture..On a landscape level major events happened: The Fukushima Accident, the 2nd nuclear exit decision by the national government, the rapid transition to RES, the highly contested discourse over national energy policy, the emergence of the climate justice movement, climate camps, wide politization of energy, climate change emerged as a topic. Neoliberal ideology of privatisation began its decline, the social question began to re-emerge in Berlin, popular protests against Vattenfall in Hamburg (new coal power station).

Each group could send one representative, so the room filled with up to 50 people. Each person had one equal vote disconected from the groups size or role..Obviously some groups and people had more time, experience and knowledge than others, especially attac and the other 2 iniators. 
An agenda for each meeting was made before hand, every one could contribute. There was an ethic of benevolence and trust.

Kalmar Energi also presented a solution to the administrative difficulties community energy projects faced in Sweden during that time. It was also a way to enable people who do not own suitable property to become prosumers of RE. 

b) The project was initiated by Kalmar Energi. Kalmar Energi is the local energy provider in the city of Kalmar in Sweden. The municipality of Kalmar holds the majority of the shares in the company. The company had the ambition to develop a solar community energy project that would tie customers closer to the company. The advantage for customers (individuals, public entities, and local companies) investing in the project was the easiest way to become prosumers, even if the production of renewable energy does not happen on site. The municipality which supported the project in numerous ways, wanted to improve its green image. 

c) The motivation for members of the community energy project and the municipality remained unchanged. Kalmar Energi, however, realised that the solution they had developed, both technically and administratively was of interest to other local energy providers. They turned their knowledge about developing and managing a community-owned solar park into a consultancy service that they now offer to interested peers.
";5;5;Self-initiated by participants;1;2;Off;2;3;3;3;3;5;Off;Off;5;Mostly confident;"a) Kalmar Energi had already initiated and managed a community-owned energy project in the region. This previous project was an offshore wind project. It laid the foundation for the solar parks in several ways. A) there was already an established and close collaboration between the company and the parts of the administration responsible for permitting the project. B) there was some experience with the legal challenges connected to collective ownership of renewable energy technology. C) it had established an imagine of the company as a trusted local agent among local inhabitants and companies. 

b) The collaboration was solely initiated by staff at Kalmar Energi who developed the idea of a community-owned solar park somewhat before approaching the municipality and potential participants. 

c) This sense was high amongst the project parties. Kalmar Energi had the expertise, the municipality the administrative authority (and as main shareholder the possibility to bin the project) and the customers had the finance. 

d) Actually, no. No significant changes observed.

Members had to be customers at Kalmar Energi. Individuals from all of Sweden could become members; companies and public entities (such as the local court house) had to be based in Kalmar. Their electricity bills were then lowered by the output of their share of the solar panels. Each share costed 1100 SEK (roughly 100 Euro). Each member has the same voting power in the association, irrespective of how many shares this actor (company, individual public entity) holds. 

b) Only members are allowed to participate in decision making. 

c) All decisions are documented in the protocols of the association. All members are invited to attend the meetings of the association. 

d) Once the project kicked-off, none were observed.

They also kept the leadership roles as they held the technical and legal expertise needed to implement the project and establish the community energy project. After technical and legal details were sorted, Kalmar Energi needed to use leadership to build coalitions with project partners, especially those that held property where the solar panels were set up. in the second phase of the project, they needed to engage in trust building in the local community. 



b) The collaborative character of the company’s approach very much reflects Scandinavian governance approaches which traditionally focus on inclusion of all stakeholders and consensus building. It also reflects the prevalent approach to avoid conflict by having relevant actors involved early on. 



c) Once the shares in the community-energy project were sold, Kalmar Energi took a step back and left future decision making to the association. Their leadership role was now only prevalent in the technical aspects of the project.

The municipality was only indirectly involved in this phase through its seat in the board of directors at Kalmar Energi. In the second phase Kalmar Energi approached different stakeholders (landowners, permitting authorities). As described above, this process was very much characterised by the Scandinavian approach to problem solving which is inclusive in character. It also involves a lot of ex-ante negotiations and coordination to mitigate conflicts before they can become an issue. 

b) The initial goals were simply set by Kalmar Energi. They did not change considerably during the process. 

c) The process changed considerably once Kalmar Energi handed over the solar park to the association. At this moment Kalmar Energi turned from being the project owner to the technical service provider. from then on, the association took all relevant decisions in their meetings.

Different actors had different objectives that were tied to the success of the project. The municipality was interested in pushing its green image and members of the cooperative wanted to become consumers. The success of the collaboration was, thus, tied to the success of the project which was subject to Swedish civil law. 

b) In the initial phase the project was held accountable by the board of Kalmar Energi, in which the municipality holds one seat. Now, the accountability of the operative actions is documented in the annual statement of accounts which is presented to the members of the cooperative. Strategic decisions are taken at the meetings of the cooperative. I assume that the annual statement of accounts is checked by a financial auditor as is normal practice in Sweden. 

c) As described, once the solar parks were handed over to the members, Kalmar Energi lost its leading role and oversight moved from the board of directors at the company to the members of the cooperative and the respective permitting authorities.

The project seems to have fulfilled the objectives the different actors had at the start of the project. The municipality boosted its green image. Kalmar Energi tied customers to the company. Members of the cooperative (individuals, local companies, and local public entities) found a convenient way to become prosumers. 

b) The project is an innovative solution to the hurdles community energy projects faced in Sweden during the time of the inception of the project. Thus, it solved a relevant problem for community energy initiatives by developing a new model. Its legitimacy is high as the project was inclusive in the place of implementation (Kalmar municipality). The unintended consequences came in the form of interest by other local energy providers who showed great interest in the model implemented in Kalmar. Now Kalmar Energi is exporting this model to other places as consultant. 

c) None observed.

Being snowfed rivers, the hydrologic processes in the Truckee river is primarily driven by snow accumulation (winter snowpack) and melt cycles (spring runoff). Approximately 90% of the flow originates in the Sierra Nevada. The water supply is sensitive to the variation in timing, form, and amount of precipitation in the eastern Sierra Nevada, as well as releases from several regulated reservoirs. 

The Truckee River Operating Agreement (TROA) was developed to resolve long-lasting water use conflicts. Negotiations of early 1990’s, which later resulted in development of TROA, were an attempt to resolve rapid water use changes in the TCRS: urbanization was increasing, environmental concerns were on the rise, and the agricultural base was a primary target for water rights acquisition. In these settings, there were four major water use groups that competed for the basin's limited water supplies: municipal and industrial water users in the urban area of Reno; farmers and livestock growers on the Newlands Project area (members of the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District); endangered native fish species of the Pyramid Lake, and wildlife habitat in the Lahontan Valley wetlands. After being negotiated for almost 30 years TROA was formally signed in September 2008 and entered into force on December 2015. The primary signatories to TROA are US Department of Interior, US Department of Justice, California State Water Resources Department, Nevada State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, and Truckee-Meadows Water Authority. The TROA replaced several court decrees and other outdated regulations that prescribed a strict year-round release of water from upstream reservoirs and maintenance of a fixed flow rate in a river system with poor consideration of seasonal fluctuation of hydrological flow and increased variation of water supply during multiple years. Some of the benefits of TROA include resolved uncertainty of interstate allocation of water from the TCRS (90% of water is allocated to Nevada); changed operational rules for reservoirs in the river system, which provides opportunity for the Truckee-Meadows Water Authority to store unused water in upstream reservoirs as a long-term drought reserve; changes were made to timing of releases and flow rates to better accommodate needs of fish species in the Pyramid Lake; and TROA provides a funding mechanism for Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge Complex to purchase more water rights and augment water supply on the territory of Wildlife Refuge. Daily administration of water allocation and water use enforcement under TROA is delegated to the US Federal Water Master, while US Bureau of Reclamation oversees operation of reservoirs. TROA now governs all interactions in the Truckee River basin and has formed the framework for continued regional cooperation on water and river basin collaboration. The organizations that are involved in TROA represent different centers of decision making (local tribal lands and large municipal utility / government, state and federal government), have different levels of authority and jurisdictions, pursue different management objectives, and have different forms of organizational structure. Nevertheless, instigated initially by litigation efforts and raising environmental concerns, signatory parties to the TROA through long-term interaction, communication and study of alternatives, were able to sign and recently started implementation of an agreement that gives more flexibility to river system management, allows some adaptability to changing climate and reduce future conflicts in water use.

";5;1;Externally directed by law or authority;1;2;Off;2;3;3;4;3;4;Off;Off;5;Reasonably confident;"To understand TROA, one should first learn about major water users in the Truckee system and past agreements that were made to meet evolving water needs. Majority of available waters of the Truckee and Carson rivers were appropriated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and this allocation remained relatively constant until the Pyramid Lake Indian Tribe challenged water allocation decisions in the 1970s. Initially, allocation of the Truckee was determined by a series of agreements that fixed the flow rates in the Truckee to maximize the beneficial use of the river for hydroelectric power generation. Truckee River flows, referred to as the Floristan rates, were first established in 1908. In 1915 the Bureau of Reclamation acquired the Lake Tahoe Dam through a consent decree. This decree gave the United States the right to raise the level of Lake Tahoe and obligated it to maintain the Floristan rates. Before the Truckee River Operating Agreement (TROA) was signed in 2008 and became operational in December 2015, the Truckee River water use was primarily controlled by the Orr Ditch decree (United States of America v. Orr Water Ditch Company, 1944), the establishment of minimum levels for Lake Tahoe, and the Truckee River Agreement of 1935. This decree was administered by a federal water master; his basic task was to maintain a minimum flow at the California-Nevada state line relative to the level of Lake Tahoe. The Carson River use is allocated by the Alpine decree (United States v. Alpine Land and Reservoir Co., 1980). It defines the water rights differently. The Orr Ditch decree defines rights as claimed appropriations, whereas the Alpine decree defines rights in terms of maximum consumptive use. Lake Tahoe storage is limited to 744,000 acre-feet, and withdrawals from the storage pool are controlled by the Truckee River Agreement, in which DOI modified the original Floristan rates to allow additional flood storage. Minimum flows of 400 cubic feet per second (cfs) are required during the winter months and 500 cfs during the summer months. Lower winter flows are allowed when the level of the lake is between 6,226.0 and 6,225.25 ft.";1-mei;6-okt;6-okt;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;3;Off;5;1;2;5;Yes;1;2;3;3;3;Off;3;Off;Not very confident;TROA was created in over a long period as part of what was initially a highly legalistic negotiations process.  Initially the process was started as a very political process during a period of high conflict.  Over the period of negotiations, rules evolved to understand the process, and by the end of the TROA negotiations it was widely considered a success.  Inclusion was however limited to those with legal claims to water from a river system that was likely overallocated, so neither all environmental nor recreational interest were represented.  Given the formal political negotiation process decision making rules were not fully transparent at the beginning of the process.  TROA should be understood as an essential part of the institutional architecture that now governs the Truckee River and all associated water uses.  ;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;3;3;3;Off;2;3;5;Off;1;Off;3;4;Reasonably confident;The process of developing TROA was a top down political process involving leadership as high as   Congressional representatives.  Leadership was critical in moving the process forward.  The style is difficult to characterize as it was aimed at resolving decades of legal battles once and for all, so a clear end point although the process to get there was complex.  It is difficult to image how TROA could have even begun without strong central leadership.  Once the process was begun, and the end goal was clear, all parties had incentives to participate.  However it is worth noting agricultural interests did not fully accept TROA, although it is now the water governance arrangement for the entire Truckee Basin.  ;5;5;5;Off;5;5;4;Off;2;1;3;Off;1;2;4;Off;1;2;1;Off;1;1;2;2;2;Off;Off;2;2;1;2;Off;Not very confident;Interactions were primarily face-to-face, although often with legal representation present.

Collaboration on the final outcomes was reached with accountability through the courts for those interest represented.  All parties had an incentive to be included in the negotiations, and it was clear that agricultural interests were the only holdouts early on, increasing the possibility that an outcome would be reached with or without fully agreement of all parties.  Oversight occurred largely due to all parties closely monitoring the actions of each other.

For utility services such as railways where there is little scope to reduce or flex demand, procuring renewable energy at the point of such demand provides a direct means of decarbonizing and securing supply. This is of particular relevance to the transport sector which has failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in many rich countries. In countries where railway electrification is still in its infancy, directly powering trains with renewables in combination with battery storage provides a low-cost decentralized alternative to costly centralized electrification solutions. In the UK, a feasibility study conducted by Riding Sunbeams suggests that around 15% of traction power demand can be supplied by direct-wire renewable energy supply, thus contributing to the decarbonization of transport. Community and commuter co-ownership of such supply assets can help democratize participation in the energy sector.

b) As part of the Small Business Research Initiative: First of a kind Round 2 funded project covered by the data, Riding Sunbeams, a non-profit organization, sought to demonstrate the technical viability of powering trains directly with renewable energy. Riding Sunbeams seeks to power railways through community and commuter co-owned renewable energy developments to maximize the social impact of this innovation. Funding provided by he UK's Department for Transport through Innovate UK supported the development of a commercial, a legal and a social value framework alongside technical demonstration. A route to market hinges upon the procurement of direct-wire renewable energy supply by Great Britain's railway infrastructure provider Network Rail through a power purchase agreement. Collaborative governance of this innovation is thus led by Riding Sunbeams in collaboration with Network Rail and supported through pre-commercial procurement by the government.

c) After extensive feasibility work and research, Riding Sunbeams connected the world's first direct-wire renewable energy installation to Great Britain's railways as part of a pilot project in August 2019 in Aldershot on one of London's busy commuter routes. Despite technical feasibility, however, Great Britain's railway infrastructure provider Network Rail has been reluctant to address commercial and legal issues standing in the way of creating a route to market through procurement. This is the result of its highly risk averse business model, high transaction costs associated with arranging associated contracts and uncertainty surrounding this innovation's feasibility at scale.";3;3;Independently convened by a third party;1;1;Off;3;3;2;3;3;3;Off;Off;3;Highly confident;"a) and b) The origins of Riding Sunbeams can be traced back to 2014 when Tom Parker, director of REPOWER Balcombe, a community energy organization from East Sussex, UK, suggested connecting a planned solar farm to the local railway through a power purchase agreement. The long-term contractual certainty of a such an agreement would help address the shortfall of declining feed-in tariff subsidies while plugging a solar farm into Network Rail's shadow grid would help overcome local distribution network constraints. Climate change advocacy 10:10 Climate Action (now We Are Possible) subsequently assembled a team to conduct a feasibility study. With support from funding through Innovate UK’s Energy Game Changers competition, researchers from the Energy Futures Lab at Imperial College London and experts from Turbo Power Systems, the technical feasibility of this innovation was established in 2017. With the help of the Feasibility Study, further funding was secured from the Rural Community Energy Fund administered by the UK's Department for Energy, Business and Industrial Strategy. This funding supported the identification of suitable pilot sites for the development of community and commuter co-owned solar traction farms. With the establishment that this innovation can work in practice as well as in principle, competitive Small Business Research Initiative: First of a kind Round 2 funding was secured in 2018. This funding, provided by the Department for Transport and administered by Innovate UK, led to the founding of Riding Sunbeams Ltd. to build and connect the world’s first solar traction demonstrator as part of the ‘First Light’ project in 2019. It also established a formal collaborative partnership with Network Rail.

c) This research involved the development of a social impact framework to address the Small Business Research Initiative: First of a kind 4C business objectives of Cost reduction (50% or more), Capacity increase (doubling), Carbon reduction (halving emissions), and Customer satisfaction (improving their experience) established by the Department for Transport. Both the 4C business objectives and the social impact framework can be interpreted as impositions by an outside sponsor (the Department for Transport). A route to market for Riding Sunbeams' innovation in Great Britain is entirely dependent on Network Rail's procurement strategy which is strongly influenced by the Office of Rail and Road's regulatory compliance requirements. Network Rail currently procures traction power supply through a single 10-year contract. Network Rail's incentive to collaborate is driven by the recognition that current decarbonization efforts are not deemed sufficient to contribute to the UK government's net zero targets and by its search for alternatives to costly centralized electrification. This is thus a highly unequal collaboration with Riding Sunbeams to gain or lose everything through the procurement of its innovation and Network Rail to gain or lose hardly anything.

d) The demonstration helped address several technological issues, related primarily to signalling and harmonics, and enabled Network Rail to take solar power traction through compliance. Efforts to establish a route to market, however, have stalled. More funding has been secured to demonstrate the technical, commercial and legal viability of this innovation at scale. Despite support and enthusiasm for this innovation within Network Rail, the Department for Transport and the media it is unclear if Network Rail are willing to change their principles of procurement to create a route to market for direct-wire renewable traction power supply.";1-mei;1-mei;1-mei;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;1;Off;2;Off;Off;Off;Yes;3;3;3;3;2;Off;2;Off;Mostly confident;"a) Initially, Riding Sunbeams was established to create a route to market for commuter and community-owned renewable energy developments through direct-wire traction power supply. This was supported through funding such as Innovate UK’s Energy Game Changers and its Small Business Research Initiative: First of a kind Round 2 funding. However, once the technical feasibility of this innovation had been demonstrated and the focus shifted towards commercial and legal feasibility it became clear that Network Rail deemed the risks and transaction costs of engaging with individual community renewable energy developments too high. The rules of collaboration that emerged required Riding Sunbeams to take on an intermediary role in securing commercial funding and driving a commercial route to market while modifying its objective to the delivery of significant social impact for line-side communities.

b) Initially, Riding Sunbeams held meetings with representative from several community energy groups which had been identified as part of the feasibility study in 2018 as suitable for direct-wire connections. As the Small Business Research Initiative project progressed, however, it became evident that large-scale demonstration at a single site would be necessary for Network Rail to assess the risks and transaction costs of procuring this innovation. As technical, commercial and legal sensitivity increased, inclusive collaborative governance efforts declined.

c) Despite support and enthusiasm for this innovation within Network Rail, the Department for Transport and the media it became clear that risk and transaction cost considerations outweighed the benefits of this innovation. The opacity of decision-making regarding these considerations made it difficult to establish the feasibility of creating a route to market and understand where leverage lies to foster institutional change and collaborative governance.

d) What started off as a collaboration among community energy groups, non-profit organizations and technological innovators on the one hand and Network Rail on the other evolved into a collaboration between Riding Sunbeams (acting as an intermediary for the community energy sector), commercial funders, Network Rail and facilitators (especially grant awarding bodies such as Department for Transport, Innovate UK, South West Local Enterprise Partnership).";Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;4;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;3;Off;4;2;Mostly confident;"a) Initially it was assumed that community energy groups would lead the development of renewable energy projects (including feasibility studies, land leases, installations, connection, operation and maintenance) to power railways, Network Rail would procure the electricity generated through power purchase agreements and Riding Sunbeams would act as a broker between them. Due to the risks and transactions costs associated with multiple supply contracts and Network Rail's existing single traction supply contract, community leadership was abandoned in favour of Riding Sunbeams taking on the developmental role. Upon completion, Riding Sunbeams would subsequently offer shares in renewable energy developments to line-side communities and commuters.

b) and c) Although Riding Sunbeams' innovation has received significant support from leading figures in the Department for Transport and Network Rail, the decision-making structure regarding the potential procurement of this innovation and underlying risk and transaction cost considerations remain opaque. At the same time, this uncertainty necessitated a shift away from community leadership of renewable energy developments towards a commercial route to market, commercial investors and a more competitive outlook.";4;4;3;Off;2;3;2;Off;3;3;3;Off;4;4;3;Off;4;4;4;Off;5;4;3;4;4;Off;Off;4;3;4;3;Off;Mostly confident;"a) Funding requirements necessitated close collaboration between Riding Sunbeams and the organizations it represents on the one hand and Network Rail on the other. The technical teams in particular collaborated closely and successfully throughout the development of the pilot site at Aldershot, UK, and the subsequent development of the pilot project. The commercial and legal teams found less common ground regarding the creation of a route to market for this innovation. Demonstration at scale will hopefully address Network Rail's concerns regarding risks and transaction costs.

b) Shared outcomes regarding the 4Cs of Cost reduction (50% or more), Capacity increase (doubling), Carbon reduction (halving emissions), and Customer satisfaction (improving their experience) were required by the Department for Transport. Funding through the South East Local Enterprise Partnership specified the creation of green jobs (up to 40 over the project's 25-year lifetime), annual carbon projected savings of over 820 tonnes/year, social and financial benefits for the local community arising from community ownership, boosting the resilience of the local electricity network and facilitating Network Rail’s ability to source low carbon power. Network Rail on the other hand appears to be primarily driven by financial and carbon savings vis-a-vis risks and transaction costs.

c) Network Rail's reluctance to procure direct wire supply from renewable sources despite successful conclusion of the Small Business Research Initiative: First of a kind Round 2 project was an indication that contribution to the 4Cs was not sufficient for Network Rail to do so. Riding Sunbeams' efforts subsequently focused more specifically on addressing the assumed risks and transaction costs that have prevented procurement to date. Overall, the emphasis shifted from community (co-)leadership to a commercial route to market while delivering significant social impact for line-side communities. As a result, commercial actors have been increasing their contribution to this project.";3;2;2;Off;1;2;3;Off;3;4;4;Off;1;3;4;1;3;4;Off;Off;3;3;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;5;1;2;2;1;3;4;3;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Reasonably confident;"a) The goals of collaboration regarding the 4Cs were included in the social impact framework. Regarding cost, commercial sensitivity regarding Network Rail's existing supply contract as well as opacity surrounding other contracts such as those with Distribution Network Operators regarding power outflow at grid supply points complicated the establishment of a traction power supply cost baseline. Regarding capacity increase, the key concern for Network Rail was whether this innovation can increase power supply at constrained grid supply points. Regarding carbon emissions, Network Rail's existing traction electricity supply contract with Energie de France is mostly from nuclear power which is relatively low carbon. If traction power supply from renewables replaces electricity supplied by nuclear power plants the carbon savings are modest. If such power is used to replace diesel locomotion the carbon savings are very significant. Similarly, if a greener railway system encourages less car use, carbon savings are also significant. It has therefore been difficult to establish Riding Sunbeams' exact contribution to the 4Cs.

b) Despite these uncertainties, Riding Sunbeams received additional funding, most prominently through the South East Local Enterprise Partnership, to power trains with renewables. Many benefits such as the 4Cs and those specified under 47 b) will only materialize over the course of 25-year project lifespan. They are nevertheless derived from existing renewable energy developments that prioritize community benefits. Riding Sunbeams' and Network Rail's social impact reporting will play a significant role in accounting for these projected benefits.

c) The shift from the vaguely formulated 4Cs to the benefits specified under 47 b) points towards growing expectations regarding both the successful development of a route to market and the social benefits associated with such a route to market. This increases the pressure on Riding Sunbeams to deliver but it fails to take into account that success or failure depend entirely on Network Rail's appetite to engage in the procurement of traction supply arrangements with unfamiliar risk and transaction cost profiles.";5;4;3;Off;2;3;4;Off;4;3;2;Off;2;3;4;Off;2;3;Off;Off;Off;4;3;Off;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;3;3;4;3;2;5;4;3;4;3;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;4;5;1;1;1;4;4;4;Off;Off;Off;2;2;1;2;2;2;1;1;1;1;Off;1;1;Off;Off;Off;4;3;3;3;4;5;2;2;3;3;2;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Mostly confident;"a) To date, the collaborative governance of traction power supply from renewable sources has demonstrated, for the first time ever, that it is possible. This in itself is a huge success and testament to the commitment of all participants to collaborate governance processes. Regarding the 4Cs it has demonstrated the reduction electricity supply and electrification cost through direct-wire solar traction power at the same or a lower price as Network Rail currently procures grid electricity; the reduction carbon emissions as direct-wire solar traction power is the lowest carbon options available to Network Rail; an increase in capacity as additional direct-wire solar traction power can be provided in grid constrained areas characterized by technical limitations to the amount of electricity that can be supplied through transmission and distribution networks; and community and commuter share ownership of electricity supply assets which maximizes social benefits of this innovation.

b) Despite these outputs, the outcomes regarding a route to market are still unclear. To date, this collaborative governance of traction power supply from renewable sources suggests that risks and transaction costs have not been sufficiently reduced for Network Rail to procure this innovation although it has achieved regulatory compliance. In particular, it is unclear how issues such as uncontrolled power outflows at grid supply points influence the procurement decision-making process and how demonstration at scale can contribute to alleviating (or amplifying) such concerns.

c) From Riding Sunbeams' perspective, the major change in collective outputs and social outcomes over time has been the shift from community leadership of renewable energy project development to the need to develop a commercial route to market whilst delivering significant social impact for line-side communities. From Network Rail's perspective, such a transition is a prerequisite to satisfy risk and transaction costs concerns associated with its principles of procurement. Funders' continued emphasis on social outcomes, on the other hand, suggest that there appears to be an underlying desire to impose these upon Network Rail and its principles of procurement.

Since 1990s, the silk printing and dyeing industry has rapidly developed in Suzhou, and almost 90 million tons of sewage were discharged from Suzhou to Jiaxing every year, causing great losses to the fishing industry and greatly adverse to local residents’ health. Jiaxing residents petitioned Suzhou government but kept failing for the local governments of Suzhou only focused on economic development rather than pollution control. In the early morning of November 22nd, 2001, Jiaxing residents sank 28 cement boats and cut off Maxi River to block the sewage from Suzhou, which is reported as the “Midnight Action” by the media. This social movement directly attracted the central government’s great attention who sent a special investigation team including deputy governors from both provinces and the deputy director of the Environmental Protection Administration to solve this cross-boundary water pollution challenge. The solution was coordinated by the investigation team: Suzhou need to reduce its pollution by two third in one year, and automatic monitoring stations would be built in the downstream for real time water quality testing. Under this mandate order, local governments of Jiaxing and Suzhou started to realize the importance of environmental protection, and initiated collaborations on information sharing, on-site joint inspection and major pollution control. As the first stage of this collaboration, the desired outcomes were to resolve the crisis caused by “Midnight Action”, including demolishing the dam formed by cement boats and monitoring water quality at the upstream.

Though started under mandates, Jiangsu province were motivated for reaching the common goal of water pollution control with Zhejiang province. During the collaboration process, local governments gradually achieved small-wins of water governance and realized the efficiency and effectiveness of collaboration, promoting their trust building and reciprocity. Besides, the central government has issued a series of policy documents for enhancing environmental governance since 2010 in the context of industrial transformation towards green development and the increased public awareness for environmental protection. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces also launched policies to implement these policies accordingly. Gradually, based on accumulated successful collaborative experience and the continuous central policy guide on environmental protection, local governments continued to deepen their collaboration. In 2012, they set up the Joint Law Enforcement Mechanism, reaching a consensus on the two-kilometer border area as the joint law enforcement area to deal with cross border issues related to water quality improvement, such as law enforcement, planning, petition, etc. Since then, the collaboration stepped into the second stage of the institutionalized and regular joint enforcement mechanism. During this stage, local participants collaborated aiming at developing a regular decision-making plan for shared water quality problem and creating innovative solutions to promote water quality effectively. Five years later, Jiaxing and Suzhou reached an agreement on establishing the Joint Leading Group for water ecology protection, which contains formal mechanisms including information exchange, joint inspection and regular meetings. This agreement marks a new and substantive stage of water collaboration between two cities, not only because they extended the collaboration from law enforcement to almost all works of water governance such as river cleaning, coastal environmental remediation, sewage inspection, garbage stacking and water quality improvement, but also broadened their joint goals to ecology protection from water quality protection. ";1;1;Externally directed by law or authority;1;3;Off;3;4;4;5;1;4;Off;Off;5;Mostly confident;"Before the first collaboration started in 2001, local officials in Jiaxing and Suzhou had seldom interacted with each other to control water pollution of Maxi River. Local residents in Jiaxing have petitioned the Jiangsu provincial government several times, but officials in Jiangsu have always been unwilling to compensate for the huge economic losses and control the water pollution. For instance, in November, 2001, the upstream sewage once again caused a large-scale dead fish incident in Jiaxing, with a loss as high as 56 million yuan. More than 30 Jiaxing fishery workers went to Jiangsu provincial government to petition, but there was no positive feedback from Jiangsu. Thus, the interaction between local residents in Jiaxing and the governments in Suzhou and even Jiangsu province was full of conflict before the collaboration. Because of the social movement of “Midnight Action”, the central sent the investigation team to coordinate the water pollution crisis and enhance Jiangsu’s incentive of environmental protection. The collaboration between Jiaxing and Suzhou was externally initiated by the investigation team from the central, which was led by the deputy director of the Environmental Protection Administration, Jirong Wang. Therefore, the interdependence between participants was lacking during this period and the mandate and coordination of the superior played a vital role in motivating collaboration.

Since the establishment of collaboration in November, 2001, local officials in Jiaxing and Suzhou began to share information, take joint inspection and even make decisions together. Therefore, stakeholders’ interactions have gradually become frequent and intensive along with the development of collaboration, and their perceptions of reciprocity and trust have also been strengthened during this process. Additionally, based on the successful past experience and interactions, local participants perceived the effectiveness and efficiency of joint action, thus deepened inter-local collaboration to the second and third stage due to their own demands. That is, the inter-local collaboration on water governance has been self-initiated by participants in these two stages. Besides stakeholders’ existing horizontal relationships, the central government has also issued a series of policy documents for enhancing environmental governance since 2010. Therefore, during these periods, stakeholders perceive higher level of interdependence between each other. Their incentives tend to be a combination of the motivation required by the superior’s mandate and also the self-needs based on their mutual interdependence.

The scope of membership contained environmental departments in both cities, and they mainly collaborated on three aspects, including information sharing, on-site joint inspection and pollution crisis control. According to the ground rules, once the pollution happens, environmental departments from these two jurisdictions would arrive the site in time to investigate the origins of pollution jointly. During this process, stakeholders would share relevant information of water pollution, and then identify the responsible departments or persons. In terms of solution, stakeholders would supervise each other on the solution of water pollution. Also, the national Environmental Protection Administration installed automatic monitoring stations in the downstream to monitor water quality in real time. The collaboration rules helped local governments to be responsible for the aftermath of the water pollution crisis. The inclusiveness of the collaboration was moderate because only relevant environmental departments were engaged. 

In the second stage, local participants set up an institutionalized joint law enforcement team to supervise the two-kilometer border area together. they have established clear ground rules for membership, working tasks, communication mechanism and others. Specifically, directors of Environmental Protection Bureau from two jurisdictions took turns every six months to lead the team, and the team included the deputy directors, law enforcement officials at the municipal and town level. The collaborative goal switch from crisis response to pollution prevention. Local actors collaborated for investigating violations to environmental regulations, restricting the development of highly polluted industries, solving environmental crises jointly, sharing information regularly and establishing communication mechanism. Local participants made joint decisions during the regular meeting every six months, which was held by two jurisdictions in turn. In the meeting, they would share the information of environmental inspection, petition, approval of construction project and others, then make action plan together. Also, local residents, enterprise representatives, scholars and the media could participate to express their opinions. Thus, both the inclusiveness and transparency of decision making are of higher level than the first stage.

In 2017, Jiaxing and Suzhou reached an agreement on joint leading group for water collaboration, extending the collaboration from joint water pollution law enforcement to the whole range of water governance, marking the beginning of the third stage of collaboration. Compared with the second stage, this leading group mechanism includes more diverse governmental departments rather than only environmental sectors, such as Development and Reform Bureau, Economic and Commercial Bureau, Transportation Bureau and others. Also, they formed a joint leading group office to coordinate and be responsible for organizing relevant activities. They made decisions about the work plan at the regular meeting every three months, and engaged into the activities of information exchange and joint inspection regularly. Therefore, the collaboration at third stage is of highly transparent and also includes more actors along with the deepening of collaborative fields.

Due to constant conflicts across the border, Jiaxing and Suzhou government could hardly communicate face-to-face when they had little prehistory of collaboration and had strong conflict of interests. The central leader, Jirong Wang, played a critical role in forming the collaboration. With hierarchical authority, he acted as the convener to bringing the relevant actors from Jiaxing and Suzhou to the table and steering them through the rough patches of the collaborative process. It is worth noting that in the authoritarian regime of China, the superior has formal authority over local governments and could coordinate the conflicts resolution process. During the collaborative process, the central leader also served as the broker and coordinator to clarify the responsibilities of Jiaxing and Suzhou. Especially, the leader empowered the relative weak stakeholder of Jiaxing by making Suzhou responsible to water pollution, and requesting it pay for the compensation for sewage discharge. This facilitative leadership was crucial for collaborative relationship initiation, which gradually build up local participants’ incentive of collaboration, setting clear ground rules, and exploring mutual gains later on.

Within the second and third stages of the collaboration, the superior leadership at provincial level emerged. The provincial governments in Zhejiang and Jiangsu gradually emphasized on environmental protection and they also formed collaboration at the provincial level. For instance, since 2009, Environmental Protection Bureau from Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai initiated a joint solving mechanism on cross-boundary environmental pollution. The superior framework of collaboration provided legitimacy and support for the collaboration at municipal level.

This mechanism was formulated under the coordination of the central leader, and local participants mainly collaborated to solve the environmental pollution and petitions at the border area. They achieved this goal by investigating the cause of crisis and clarify stakeholders’ responsibilities together. When reaching consensus on the division of responsibilities, according to the principle of territorial jurisdiction, relevant departments carried out regulatory activities to solve their own environmental problems. 

During the second stage, stakeholders interacted with each other through the regular meeting and joint law enforcement mechanism. According to the agreement signed by Jiaxing and Suzhou, local participants held the regular meeting every six months to share information of monitoring and law enforcement, pollution control, petitions, approval of construction projects within the two-kilometer border area. Moreover, once environmental pollution happens, local governments were supposed to investigate the origins and take emergency measures within their own jurisdictions, then inform the other side about the progress timely. Meanwhile, stakeholders should organize joint law enforcement together, and punish the enterprises with illegal pollution behavior within their own jurisdiction according to the principle of territorial management. Therefore, stakeholders formulated and achieved shared outcomes through information sharing, joint decision making and law enforcement, to guarantee the environmental quality.

Since February 2017, the collaboration between Jiaxing and Suzhou entered into a new and substantive stage of water governance. The agreement on joint leading group set up participants’ interaction mechanisms from the perspectives of information sharing, decision making, joint inspection and regular meeting. Within this stage, more local participants from diverse departments interact with each other more frequently and the rules of interactive mechanisms are better established than before. Specifically, stakeholders are supposed to share the monitoring information of water quality at the border once a month, and the important safety information should be reported in a timely manner. Additionally, participants of the adjacent towns would clarify their responsibilities and formulate work plan together with detailed goals and timeline, so as to ensure the efficiency of water governance in the border areas. In terms of joint inspection, they have agreed on carrying out joint law enforcement inspection at least once a quarter, to find out existing problems and inform the partner timely. The results of joint inspection would be discussed on the regular meeting, which is also arranged at least once every quarter. Relevant officials would communicate with each other and carry out law enforcement measures respectively within their own jurisdictions based on the agreed work plan.

The goal achievement was monitored by the central and stakeholders together. Two cities supervise each other on the solution of water pollution. The national Environmental Protection Administration installed automatic monitoring stations in the downstream to monitor water quality in real time to hold both cities accountable. Local citizens petitioned to relevant government sectors to generate social pressure on environmental crisis resolution.

In the second stage, participants from Jiaxing and Suzhou determined their collaborative goals together during the regular meeting every half year, which was held by two jurisdictions in turn. Stakeholders monitored each other’s law enforcement actions within their own jurisdictions at the border. Local officials should report the processing results of pollution to their partners after the actions. Also, environmental departments from two jurisdictions would organize joint law enforcement actions in the border areas to solve environmental problems efficiently. Local residents, enterprise representatives, scholars and the media participate the regular meeting to express their opinions and monitor governmental behavior of environmental governance. 

Since 2017, inter-local collaboration between Jiaxing and Suzhou has been deepened into the third stage. Similar with the second stage, stakeholders would arrange regular meeting to formulate the goals and work plan together at least once every quarter. Relevant officials would carry out joint law enforcement inspection at least once a quarter, and monitor partners’ joint law enforcement measures respectively within their own jurisdictions based on the agreed work plan. It is worth noting that the central government has paid more and more attention to regional water governance since 2015, establishing policy documents such as “The action plan for water pollution control”, “Opinions on the implementation of river chief system”. Within the authoritarian regime of China, the central’ political attention is usually accompanied by performance assessment. In 2016, the central government upgraded the environmental protection task as a “Party and Government Shared Responsibility” from a purely administrative task. From then on, local environmental performance is not only assessed by the higher-level administrative department but also by the higher-level party committee. Comparing to administrative requests, political assessment presents a stronger pressure and incentive over local officials. Therefore, during this stage, the goal achievement of water quality tends to be consistent with the superior’s performance assessment, then the inter-local collaboration could borrow the traditional monitoring mechanism within the hierarchical system to guarantee joint action and environmental performance.

According to the interview, local officials in Jiaxing stated that this collaboration has been proved to be effective and efficient in solving cross-boundary pollution crisis. For instance, in June 2005, Wujiang Hengxiang Alcohol Manufacturing Co., Ltd. in Suzhou illegally discharged high-concentration accidental process wastewater, causing thousands of acres of water pollution to the downstream of Jiaxing. One hour after the incident, the deputy directors and supervisors of the environmental protection bureaus from two jurisdictions all arrived at the spot and investigated the accident. Five days later, they clarified the relevant persons responsible for this accident and signed a compensation agreement on August 2. Therefore, collaborative goals were fulfilled with designed outcome achieved. No unintended consequences were observed or reported. 

In the second stage, stakeholders set up the joint law enforcement team, and achieved the outputs of collaborative actions such as sharing information, joint law enforcement, restricting the development of highly polluting industries and others. Compared with the collaboration in first stage, local actors emphasized more on preventing pollution crisis beforehand during this stage. As a result, the water quality in the border areas was improved while local citizens’ petitions were reduced significantly, as the cross-boundary pollution crisis was solved innovatively. Thus, stakeholders fulfilled the output and outcome goals, and there were no unintended consequences.

Since February 2017, Jiaxing and Suzhou established the joint leading group, carrying out the actions of information sharing, joint inspection and regular meeting. Distinguished with other stages, this collaborative mechanism extends the field from joint law enforcement to a series work of water governance such as river cleaning, coastal environmental remediation, sewage inspection, garbage stacking and water quality improvement. Till the end of May 2018, local participants have held joint meetings for 8 times, and solved more than 16 problems related to coastal environmental improvement, river cleaning, river dredging and joint monitoring. They carried out joint law enforcement activities for more than 10 times, solving more than 20 environmental problems and salvaging 12,200 tons of water hyacinth. Motivated by the central’s policy attention and mutual interdependence, stakeholders have contributed substantial efforts to implement the agreement and designed plan. The outputs and outcomes of collaboration have been fulfilled successfully. Moreover, two jurisdictions have reached an unintended output of collaboration: signing a dredging project of Maxi River and investing 100 million yuan jointly for implement this project. This is the first time that these two jurisdictions have contributed a large amount of financial resources to improve water quality and ecology during their collaboration for nearly two decades.

The India National Government’s Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2016 devolved the responsibility for MSW to municipal authorities (in this case the Gangtok Municipal Corporation) as well as enforcing mandatory waste segregation of waste, and guidance on landfill, waste and water treatment. However, compliance with these rules by municipal governments in Sikkim is limited, with only approximately 50% of the MSW rules being followed by local bodies (Sharma 2019 p.1213). In 2014, the ICLEI ACCCRN report identified key vulnerabilities with regard to the changing climate in Gangtok. Crucially, the report highlighted the impact of clogged jhoras (drainage streams), which exacerbate the climate induced vulnerabilities by polluting water and further increasing the risk of landslides (ICLEI / ACCCRN n.d. p.2).
  The ICLEI ACCCRN report found that due to the Gangtok Municipal Corporation’s (GMC) limited mandate, its ability to combat climate change is significantly limited with the resources available, a sentiment shared by Khan who wrote that “in addition to a poor revenue base… [Gangtok is] also constrained by inefficient organizational and human resources, lack of conducive environment for climate-based actions, red tapism, bureaucratic diplomacy and limited jurisdictional empowerment” (Khan 2018 p.4). With these limitations in mind, the IAP report recommend the need to proactively improve waste management (ICLEI / ACCCRN n.d. p.2) and so on the advice of ICLEI / ACCCRN, Gangtok Municipal Corporation submitted a proposal to ACCCRN small grants fund, provided by the Rockefeller Foundation, for the construction of an organic waste composter with the objective of closing the food and waste loop.
    (b) Mitigating the landslide risk caused by inefficiencies in municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal was the primary motivation of GMC in their proposal to ACCCRN, though Mayor Shri Shakti Singh Choudhary was also keen to involve Gangtok with international level environmental programmes, as well as to bypass the bureaucratic and financial constraints posed by conventional routes to securing approval and funding for such projects at the state and national level. The water system will benefit from a reduction of waste going to landfill sites such as the one at Matam which, due to an oversupply of unsegregated waste, and its close proximity to water sources, has resulted in water pollution. The food system likewise benefits from a greater abundance of organic compost which the farmers can use to improve soil fertility and boost yields. The Kanchenjuna Shopping Complex generates around one ton of vegetable waste per day which, due to a lack of alternatives was transported to landfill, with the vehicles carrying out this role generating fuel waste and causing emissions. Intermittent collection meant that waste was often left on the street, or dumped in jhoras (small drainage streams) resulting in further pollution of water sources, as well as blocking drainage systems which made the city more vulnerable to landslides. Uncollected waste likewise posed a public health risk, attracting disease spreading insects such as mosquitos. The installation of the OWC means that organic waste from the market no longer goes to landfill, saving on fuel and emissions, as well as reducing the waste which blocks and pollutes the city’s jhoras.

1) ICLEI South Asia and ACCCRN. ICLEI South Asia was contracted by the Asian Cities for Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) to develop City Resilience Strategies for 40 cities across South Asia (Khan 2020 interview). Together ICLEI and ACCCRN developed the ICLEI ACCCRN Process (IAP) as a toolkit to “enable local governments to assess their climate risks in the context of urbanisation, poverty and vulnerability and [to] formulate corresponding resilience strategies” (Gawler & Tiwari 2014 p.6).
(2) Federal and Regional government. The India National Government’s Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2016 devolved the responsibility for MSW to municipal authorities (in this case the Gangtok Municipal Corporation) as well as enforcing mandatory waste segregation of waste, and guidance on landfill, waste and water treatment. However, compliance with these rules by municipal governments in Sikkim is limited, with only approximately 50% of the MSW rules being followed by local bodies (Sharma 2019 p.1213).
(3) Rockefeller Foundation. Had previous projects together with the ACCCRN.

(b) ICLEI South Asia made contact with 40 cities including Gangtok to gauge interest in joining the network and increasing urban resilience through the IAP. This was met with enthusiasm from Gangtok’s Mayor Shri Shakti Singh Choudhary, keen to improve the city’s resilience in the context of both a changing climate, and urbanization. 

In 2014, the ICLEI ACCCRN report identified key vulnerabilities with regard to the changing climate in Gangtok. Crucially, the report highlighted the impact of clogged jhoras (drainage streams), which exacerbate the climate induced vulnerabilities by polluting water and further increasing the risk of landslides (ICLEI / ACCCRN n.d. p.2). The IAP report recommend the need to proactively improve waste management (ICLEI / ACCCRN n.d. p.2) and so on the advice of ICLEI / ACCCRN, Gangtok Municipal Corporation submitted a proposal to ACCCRN small grants fund, provided by the Rockefeller Foundation, for the construction of an organic waste composter with the objective of closing the food and waste loop.

GMC received funding of 3,000,000 Indian Rupees (approx. $40,000) from the Rockefeller Foundation’s ACCCRN Small Grants Program to implement a bio-composting initiative entitled: ‘Climate resilient solid waste management infrastructure for Gangtok: installation of an Organic Waste Composter (1 MT per day) for composting vegetable market waste (Kanchenjunga Shopping Complex)’ (ICLEI 2019 p.11). In line with national laws, including the 2016 Solid Waste Management Rules which devolved the responsibility for MSW to the municipal level and promotes the setting up of decentralised compost plants or bio methanation plants in or near markets; a bio-composting plant was established at the vegetable market in the Kanchenjunga Shopping Complex.

ICLEI encouraged Gangtok Municipal Corporation to engage with a broader range of actors than it might normally involve (Archer et al 2017 p.22) so as to garner the knowledge of a wide range of individuals. 
     Such SLD sessions were therefore facilitated by ICLEI South Asia and the International Institute for Environmental Development (IIED) with key stakeholders in the city including Mayor Shakti Singh Choudhary, and individuals from NGOs, universities, various governmental departments including Public Health Engineering, The Urban Development and Housing Department, Science and Technology and others (ICLEI South Asia n.d). This enabled the IAP to gain insight from a wide range of individuals to identify the main environmental problems facing the city, as well as the most vulnerable groups and ultimately to feed into the city resilience strategy. This consultation took place during each phase of the IAP ensuring that the stakeholder group could provide insight into the main environmental challenges the city faced, vulnerable groups, and means of improving resilience.  Crucially, the SLD process is multi-directional, enabling the stakeholder group to not only feed into the initiative, but to also gain knowledge from the other stakeholders. This two-way transfer allowed the project to maintain public engagement, as well as helping the core climate team tasked with implementation to identify the challenges and opportunities for the city’s initiative. Stakeholders for the group were chosen on four primary considerations: 
1. Those who have the ability to develop Resilience Actions at the community level 
2. Those whose support will be essential to implement Resilience Actions at different levels (e.g. community, city level) 
3. Those most affected by Resilience Actions developed

     Thus, the SLD learning workshops are carried out with community engagement in mind, inviting stakeholders based upon their connection to, and ability to undertake a two-way knowledge transfer with the wider community. This was also achieved by the establishment of a communications plan aimed at parlaying key messages of the IAP with target groups (Gawler & Tiwari 2014 p.9). In Gangtok this communications plan included community programmes designed to educate and inform people about both the plant and waste more generally (ACCCRN 2017 p.17)
     Alongside the SLD workshops, the city recruited both trained engineers, one of whom we spoke to, and individuals who received on the job training. The wider population, including vegetable vendors, were likewise educated on the process of composting and their role in collecting, segregating and disposing of waste correctly through a campaign of posters within the market itself (Khan 2020 interview) (see below). In addition to this, GMC undertook public outreach programmes encouraging the responsible disposal of waste, as well as the composting of organic waste where possible (Archer et al 2017 p.25).";Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;1;Off;5;5;3;Off;5;5;5;Off;5;Off;5;3;Highly confident;"
Public awareness, education, and buy in has also been essential for the success of the initiative. Both Gangtok Municipal Corporation (GMC) and the Vegetable Market Association have been the key institutions involved in educating the public. In particular, gaining buy-in from vegetable vendors was a challenge in the initial stages that was mostly overcome with the help of the Vegetable Vendors Association in conducting awareness activities and meetings (ICLEI 2018 p.18). Whilst there is still an issue with receiving unsegregated waste from the vegetable vendors (ICLEI 2019 p.18) there has now been broad buy in from the vendors as a result of this collaborative approach between the GMC and Vegetable Market Association (Khan interview 2020). 

The knowledge sharing from ICLEI ACCCRN project has likewise been significantly useful in the successful application of the initiative, highlighting initially the vulnerability that needed to be addressed in the City Resilience Strategy, as well as in providing technical knowledge on available composting technologies, and crucially for the above public buy-in, providing facilitation in Shared Learning Dialogue sessions. 

Regulation and political will as a component that required leadership in Gangtok

The state of Sikkim has been ahead of the curve on state level environmental governance for some time before the introduction of the national level MSW management. Sikkim’s legally enforced shift to organic farming as well as significant moves toward banning single use plastics highlights that an informal movement to improve the environment across the municipality exists within government. Likewise, at the municipal level Mayor Shakti Singh Choudhary highlighted that “The political will in the city is proactive and motivated to implement solutions to common municipal issues. This significantly reduced hurdles to the implementation of the solution as the political buy in influenced social buy-in” (ICLEI 2019 p.17). This is an account that is backed up by a city officer who told us that Mayor Shakti Singh Choudhary himself was the main driving force in pushing the initiative forward (Khan 2020 interview). That being said, despite the informal institution of political will, the formal institution of the 2016 Solid Waste Rules in devolving authority to the municipal level was the main institutional factor enabling this initiative to take place.

b) A bio-composting plant was established at the vegetable market in the Kanchenjunga Shopping Complex. The one-ton Organic Waste Composter (OWC), installed by Reddonatura India Pvt Ltd and operated and maintained by the Gangtok Municipal Corporation, converts segregated organic waste from the vegetable market into compost, reducing the volume of waste by up to 80-90% (ICLEI 2019 p.11).

c) The installation of the OWC means that organic waste from the market no longer goes to landfill, saving on fuel and emissions, as well as reducing the waste which blocks and pollutes the jhoras. The compost produced is then sold to local farmers, closing the food-waste loop.

The wider population including vegetable vendors were likewise educated on the process of composting and their role in collecting and separating vegetable waste and disposing of it correctly through a campaign of posters within the market itself (Khan 2020 interview) (see below). In addition to this, GMC undertook public outreach programmes encouraging the responsible disposal of waste, as well as the composting of organic waste where possible (Archer et al 2017 p.25).
    Given the small scale of the initiative, and the difficulty in contacting GMC officials, likely due to Covid, quantitative data on the effects of the initiative on the local FWEN have been hard to find. The papers covering the initiative, as well as the interviews we conducted, have provided a qualitative picture of improvements to the local environment, in particular the surroundings of the market itself which no longer faces the health and social impacts of vegetable waste being dumped on the street outside the market (Sharma interview 2020). Khan suggested that the composting plant had resulted in a reduction in pollution and blockages in local jhoras, though due to a lack of quantitive data the extent to which this has reduced the issue of landslides is unknown. We know for certain that the initiative has not conclusively solved the issue of landslides due to its small size, as has been confirmed by recent news reports of landslides in the area (e.g. New Indian Express 2020). Likewise, no before and after studies have been conducted to assess the impacts on water quality and thus the exact impact of the plant on water quality in Gangtok is unknown, though with 1 tonne of waste per day being composted (Lama interview 2020) that would ordinarily have gone to the landfill site at Martam it follows that water pollution from the over-supplied Martam landfill site has reduced as a result of the initiative.
     Mayor Shakti Singh Choudhary told ICLEI that the initiative has diverted waste from landfill and jhoras reducing energy consumption, emissions and pollution. In addition to this, it reduces the dependency on the city on imported water from the river Rataychu to supply peri-urban agricultural areas which can be supplied by previously polluted and blocked jhoras thereby improving water and energy efficiency (ICLEI 2019 p.12).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The countries were themselves not able to adequately contain or mitigate the outbreak. Stopping Ebola seemed to require significant outside assistance. In the early and middle periods, most front-line response efforts from outside of these countries were undertaken by non-governmental organizations such as Doctors Without Borders (MSF) (March through August). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) more generally recognized in the middle period (July) that Ebola was not being contained and mitigated. The WHO and the three affected national governments created a joint Ebola response plan (on 31 July). The WHO then declared the Ebola epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (on 8 August 2014). It called on national governments from across the world sought to contribute to response, particularly in the way of health care personnel. Many governments then began to provide funding, health care personnel, and/or other kinds of support. Funding contributions were significantly increased in the weeks following 8 August. On 19 September, the UN sought to further coordinate these responses by creating its ""first-ever UN emergency health mission"", a stand-alone field agency. Health care personnel pledges picked up during September (though most of these were never realized). Actual government-sponsored personnel deployments from abroad also began in September, and increased during subsequent months.

B) The calls for health care workers (HCWs) came from NGOs in the early period. With the recognition of the epidemic as a global health concern in August, the WHO also began to call for more HCWs as the primary goal of international response.

C)
Collaborators = NGOs (MSF, etc), United Nations agencies (WHO, World Bank, UNMEER), national governments.

Early period = March-June 2014 -- NGO calls for HCWs, respond in the field. UN agencies (WHO) sends advisors and observers; national governments do not respond.

Middle Period = July-August 2014 -- NGOs call for HCWs, respond in the field. WHO recognizes threat and coordinates with the affected governments. It eventually calls for HCWs and other resources. Funding from national governments and World Bank takes off in mid-August

Late Period = September-December 2014 -- UNMEER created to coordinate responses within and across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. 29 national governments pledge HCW support (total on record 6681), 26 eventually dispatch some HCWs (total on record 2545).


";5;6;Independently convened by a third party;3;1;Off;3;5;1;5;3;5;Off;Off;3;Reasonably confident;"A) NGOs, UN organizations, and national governments have long histories of interaction around transnational issues as well as capacity enhancement in low income contexts. However, prior to the Ebola epidemic in 2014 international collaboration around response to public health crises had generally focused on pooling and sharing information rather than providing health care capacity in the field.

B) While the WHO sent observers and advisors to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in response to the Ebola outbreak from March 2014, the mobilization of an international collaborative response kicked off when the WHO and the national governments of the three affected countries launched an Ebola Response Plan on 31 July. This was followed by a formal Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO on 8 August. Finally, the UN created the UNMEER agency to coordinate Ebola responses in the region on 19 September.

C) Explanations for the responses or non-responses to Ebola by governments around the world have not been fully tested. However, interdependency is likely to have figured in the calculations of at least some of the responding governments in the sense that an increasing outbreak of Ebola in West Africa increased the risk of spread through travelers to regions further afield (so public health outside of the affected countries depended on the response within the countries, and in turn, the three affected countries depended on other countries to combat the epidemic). For instance, the United States received a small number of travelers from the region with Ebola symptoms. It also sent medical personnel as well as various other kinds of field response units primarily to Liberia. Responding in the field could arguably reduce to the risk of the Ebola epidemic to US public health. Similarly, many European countries, and the UK and France primarily, responded by dispatching health care personnel to the Ebola affected areas, arguably to reduce the risk of the epidemic spreading further afield. Several African countries also sent teams of health care workers to the area. In turn, the three affected countries depended on these contributions because their own public health systems were unable to stop the spread and treat all affected patients.

D) In the early stage (March-June), response from outside the affected countries was primarily from NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders. The the middle stage (July-August), this remained true, but the WHO and the UN more generally began to respond by actively mobilizing the international community. In the late stage (September and onward), several national governments donated funds and other resources, and/or dispatched health care personnel to the region.";1-mei;1-mei;1-mei;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;3;Off;4;Off;Off;Off;Yes;1;Off;3;Off;3;Off;Off;Yes;Not very confident;"In the early stage, action was primarily undertaken by NGOs. The extent of their collaboration and coordination is unclear. In the middle stage, the WHO and affected governments began to actively collaborate and issued a formal response plan; they were joined by a number of governments as well as regional organizations (the European Union and the African Union) from outside the affected areas. During this time, the rules are likely to have been clarified. In the late stage, the WHO issued a road map for Ebola response, and the UN set up the UNMEER agency with the explicit purpose of coordinating Ebola response. At this stage, rules for the response collaboration were likely to be at their clearest.

The transparency of national decisions about Ebola response varies. In contexts where governments are obliged to share information, it is possible to trace national decisions about whether and how to respond. In other contexts, such studies are far more difficult.

As suggested previously, the institutional architecture for Ebola 2014 response collaboration shifted significantly over time. From NGO-based in the early stage, to WHO-based in the middle stage, to UNMEER-based in the late stage.";Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Reasonably confident;"A) In the early stage, leadership was questionable since NGOs would send teams to the field at their own initiative. In the middle stage, the WHO and affected national governments put a plan in place and took charge of mobilizing response from abroad. In the late stage, UNMEER, a specialized UN agency, was in charge of Ebola response for the whole affected area.

The modes in the distribution of new cases over time was during the weeks in mid-September, with around 1000-1100 new cases as the weekly maximum (locating the exact maximum is complicated by the existence of two similar but not identical counts of cases, and by data being recorded by week rather than shorter time periods).  

The bulk of international responses to the epidemic came in the form of funding as well as health care worker deployments. The bulk of funding was contributed during or after the peak of the epidemic in terms of cases. Similarly, most health care workers dispatched from abroad arrived after weekly case counts had begun to decline.

In a report from December 2014, three months after the WHO ramped up an internationally coordinated response, the NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF) offered a critique of the state of the response to that point: ""Instead of the well-coordinated, comprehensive and expertly-staffed intervention MSF called for ninety days ago, actual efforts have been sluggish and patchy, falling dangerously short of expectations"" (p. 1).

The response process did include innovation. Rather than relying solely on existing WHO and other UN agency resources to manage and coordinate response, the UN established UNMEER as an agency for response (""the first-ever UN emergency health mission""; https://ebolaresponse.un.org/un-mission-ebola-emergency-response-unmeer). However, this step toward an operational field agency was closed down again in July 2015 -- UNMEER was a 'temporary mission'. 

It also included coordinated responses to an international health emergency by 26 national governments that included deployments of health care personnel outside of their own borders. For some, this was outside of their normal operational capacities. In addition, the call  from the WHO for feet on the ground was a step beyond its established collaborative mechanisms for pooling and sharing research data and laboratory capacity.

Friends of Redington Pass began as an informal voluntary group in November 2009 committed to improving environmental conditions on Redington Pass, a neglected area of the Coronado National Forest east of Tucson, Arizona, USA. Its early membership included local hikers, dirt bikers, horseback riders, hunters, and nearby residents. Initially FRP focused on safety concerns around the recreational target shooting (RTS) areas and the interests of non-motorized recreationists. Towards the end of 2013, FRP expanded expand its mission as well as its Board membership (See next section) to create a broader and more inclusive network of recreation and conservation groups to work alongside the Coronado National Forest and other public agencies. Recreational interests became the central concern along with continuing conservation interests. FRP began pursuing a new role as an umbrella organization for all friends of Redington Pass to serve as a balanced and open forum to discuss our common and diverse interests in the future of Redington Pass. The following vision and mission statement articulates their ambitions and desired outcomes
Vision Statement
Friends of Redington Pass envision protection of the rural backcountry setting of Redington Pass for all recreational and resource users, while providing for public access and management of future diversified recreational growth.
Friends of Redington Pass (FRP) advocates for the responsible stewardship of the Redington Pass area, balanced recreational and resource uses and the preservation of its ecological, scenic, and cultural resources. FRP seeks to bring together representatives from all user groups in furtherance of its objectives and consistent with the 2013 Coronado National Forest Draft Forest Plan Revision.
FRP advocates for:
• Conservation and restoration of sensitive riparian areas along the Tanque Verde Creek, its watershed and wildlife corridors throughout the Pass
• Improved opportunities for dispersed recreational activities on the Pass, assuring clean, natural settings and well-managed motorized and non-motorized uses
• Reductions in unsafe or illegal activities and excessive noise and disturbance throughout Redington Pass.
--------------------------------------------
*Note re next section (a) since I didn’t have room to include it there: There was limited interaction among the participants before FRP started evolving. Several in the core group lived in the nearby neighborhood but were not well acquainted. Some individuals had interactions with users of the Pass when they recreated there. Essentially, there was a void, with the absence of active management by CNF, that needed to be filled, as issues on the Pass became more salient around RTS and OHV use.
";1;2;Self-initiated by participants;3;3;Off;2;3;3;2;2;4;Off;Off;3;Highly confident;"Over the first 3-4 years, FRP reached out to all recreational users in the Pass and learned more about its many highly valued resources and diverse recreation interests as well as the persistent challenges to assuring safe, clean, and enjoyable conditions on the Pass now and in the future.

In the spring of 2010, the Coronado National Forest (CNF) alerted the public to their proposed revision of the Coronado National Forest Working Draft Management Plan (CNF-WDMP), dated March 2010. This galvanized the interest of several people living near Redington Pass. On March 18th, they convened an open meeting with the CNF District Ranger and representatives of the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the Pima County Sheriff’s office to discuss issues and answer questions about the plan and conditions along the Pass.

Under the umbrella of an informal working group that came to be known as the “Friends of Redington Pass”  or “FRP” they registered their concerns through comments submitted April 30 to the Forest Service that were formally endorsed by the LCE Homeowners Association Board, the Forty Niner’s Homeowners Association, Rinconado Estates Homeowners Association, Tanque Verde Guest Ranch, Cascabel Working Group, Cascabel Hermitage Association, Saguaro Juniper Corporation, Sky Island Alliance, and Environmental and Cultural Conservation Organization. One hundred and ten individual endorsers also signed on to the comments concerning the CNF-WDMP.
A second opportunity arose to provide input to CNF when it issued a draft Environmental Assessment of Proposed Changes to Motorized Travel System. During the summer of 2010, a core group of FRP volunteers went on several field trips with Forest Service personnel to study the road conditions and discuss specific recommendations for road authorizations, improvements and closures. This led to the submission of formal comments on behalf of the Friends of Redington Pass on September 19th.
In 2011, the group formalized and became a non-profit 501 c (3), established bylaws and created a board.  During that time, extensive concentrations of lead were found by a board member through sampling on three of the most heavily used sites for recreational target shooting (RTS). Lab results convinced CNF to do their own sampling which resulted in the designation and closure of these sites under RCRA for superfund clean-up. Over $500,000 was spent by CNF contractors to remove contaminated soils and restore the sites. This led understandably to concerns in the RTS community about the intentions of FRP and its orientation to shooting in the Pass.

FRP learned that in order to address this budding conflict and other recreational and conservation challenges, the Pass needed a strong inclusive network of all user groups to work alongside CNF and other public agencies. FRP participants recognized that they could not achieve their original mission nor a broader more inclusive one unless they also generated a more proactive interest in the Pass and leaned forward to anticipate and advocate for a better future for the Pass. They agreed that they had to work to bring people together for the sake of the Pass and their individual and shared interests.

As a consequence, in 2013, FRP expanded its vision, mission statement and objectives as well as the composition of its board to pursue a new role as an umbrella organization of all friends of Redington Pass. They began to work together to provide a balanced and open forum to discuss those differences and seek to reach shared goals and strategies together.

Over time, board responsibilities, ground rules, and decision rules were adopted. 

Board Members Agreement
As a Member of the Board of FRP my duties and responsibilities include:
1. To know the mission, history, policies, and programs of the organization and to be able to describe them accurately.
2. To work with other board members to carry out the mission of FRP, while constructively representing the interests or concerns of my home organization or constituency
3. To act as both an informal and, when requested, formal ambassador and spokesperson for FRP.
4. To attend each FRP meeting with the understanding that during meeting discussions:
a. Civility is expected and negative personal comments are not appropriate;
b. Everyone is to be respectful of one another’s views, even if disagreeing with them;
c. Everyone will try to stay relevant and on task
d. Meeting decisions and announcements will be retained in writing.
5. To support consensus decisions of the board on policies relating to its mission and programs.  Consensus decisions mean that 85% of the board agrees to level 4 or 5 and no one is at level 1 based upon the following 5 point scale:
5= I wholeheartedly agree.
4= I agree, it is okay
3= I am neutral
2= I disagree, but will go along
1= I hate this and will work to stop it
 Anyone at level 1 should work to present and advocate for a different approach to the issue at hand consistent with the mission of the organization.  If a consensus decision cannot be reached, the board will continue to work on the issue, considering options, including a “minority report”.
6. To attend as many meetings and other activities of the organization with the understanding that three consecutive unexcused absences from board meetings will be considered resignation from the board.
7. To accept fiduciary responsibility for the organization and oversee its financial health and integrity.
8. To provide oversight to ensure that our programs run effectively.
9. To serve as an ambassador to the community to educate others and promote our work.
10. To participate in fundraising to ensure that our organization has the resources it needs to meet its mission.  
11. To act in the best interest of the organization, and to excuse myself from discussions and votes where I have a conflict of interest.
To resign from the board, if I find that I cannot meet the requirements of the board, due to conflict of interest, lack of time, or lack of commitment.

CAMP participants created ground rules for public and working group meetings. 

Ground Rules 
• Be respectful of different perspectives
•  Listen and be patient when others are talking
•  Keep remarks brief to assure time for all to comment
•  Be prepared to compromise
•  Remember shared values, consider each other’s interest, trust
•  Ask for input from everyone
•  Stay on topic, focused (may need timekeeper, “parking lot” space) 
•  Be mindful of those non-represented 
•  Open minded, understanding different invested interests 
•  Flexibility
 
Decision Rules
Work toward full agreement (consensus) on procedural issues, information issues, and priority setting. 
• On final decisions about recommendations to CNF, consensus defined by 85% at level 3, 4 or 5, and no more than one person at level 1.  (Objecting person should strive to offer alternative recommendation that meets others needs)
• If group remains divided (2 or more people at level 1 or 2), or if there is a strong minority concern, those concerns should be documented in reports.";Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;4;Off;5;5;4;Off;5;5;3;Off;5;Off;5;4;Highly confident;"As the President and main facilitator of the group for 9 years, I would describe my leadership style as collaborative and committed. There was a core group that became formalized into an executive committee of the board that worked together on all policy and strategic directions before presenting them for discussion at the Board meetings. I very much doubt that FRP would have made much progress without committed leadership, nor was it likely they would have done the CAMP. If they had the funds they could have hired an outside process manager/facilitator, but I doubt that would have been feasible. 

In fall of 2017, I began to prepare FRP for my departure from the group and spent considerable time working with the board and with the executive committee on leadership transition issues, well knowing how vulnerable these CGRs are to leadership change. This coincided with an organizational transition from a planning group to an operating entity co-managing activities beyond the clean up days, After 1.5 years, they finally had a succession plan and I stepped down (and out). The past year, from my more indirect observations and discussions with the new President and a few board members FRP is holding its own, amending the bylaws, recruiting new members to the board, retaining an outside accountant and attorney (previously an early board member had been an attorney and provide legal services free to the group). 

One of the major leadership concerns that has existed throughout FRP’s life, is the CNF leadership and staff capacity which changes frequently and is understaffed and less knowledgeable about the Pass than FRP because of such great turnover. The lag time for CNF response to FRP proposals puts a serious dint in the momentum of the group, particular at this important juncture.

By group, I am referring to the organizing hub of the network which was formalized into a board.

The shared motivation of the group grew over time after initial recruitment and initial successes (CNF reception to FRP comments on the CNF plan, initial closure and clean up of RTS sites). Based on the observations of the group leader, the relational elements of that motivation became more cohesive, including trust, mutual understanding, internal legitimacy and commitment. The CAMP process created a bandwagon effect and as the group diversified and new members came on board, this cohesion was stretched and some interpersonal tensions developed. With leadership change and the coincidental departure of a few other original core members, renewed efforts on the part of the new president are now required to strengthen shared motivation.

The skillfulness of the group as it engaged in defining problems, deliberating and reaching decisions increased over time. With modeling behavior by the president and formalization of ground rules and broad responsibilities these interactions became more efficient and effective. 

The capacity of the group for taking actions together increased. More participants volunteered more time and effort and became more knowledgeable about the Pass.  A great example is in the fall of 2017, after the CAMP process, the group agreed there was a need for a second website that featured information about the Pass that would be useful for recreational visitors, distinct from promoting FRP. Each participant was able within 10 days to create excellent content for their interest area.  See http://friendsofredingtonpass.org/about_rp.html   This would not have been possible at the outset of FRP and probably not before the CAMP process. Early on, individual skill sets and resources were acknowledged by the group and then called on and expected to be contributed (distributing flyers, making signs, outreach to media, web development, clean up coordination).  Specialization began to occur. AT its best, there was a good fit between the capacities needed and available through the participants. But this capacity varied as participants withdrew or had to be replaced with others who might not bring the same skill set or resources to the table.

The goals were formulated initially by the informal group, then by the FRP board members, then drafted by the executive committee who then presented them to the board for discussion and approval. Monitoring of the goals was done rather loosely and took the form of a newsletter account of annual accomplishments that the President drafted and had the board review and revise before sending to membership and uploaded to the website.

b. This was a self-funded, volunteer group accountable to the group and to the organizations and networks that were represented. The CAMP process became a way of engaging the larger community and growing members in the planning for the Pass. For example, through a collaborative community mapping exercise and survey, FRP drafted statements of shared values and concerns for Redington Pass that were further refined at a subsequent public meeting. See below:

What People Appreciate about Redington Pass 

• Its Rural Backcountry Landscape reveals an open desert mountain pass with scenic panoramas, broad plateaus, and diverse undeveloped landscape features.

• Its Crossroads Location links two watersheds east to west and two mountain ranges north to south, providing habitat for diverse plants and animals and multiple access points and corridors for wildlife movement and human recreation.

• Its Lasting Quality offers visible reminders of the natural and human history of the Southwest still preserved as public lands in an unfragmented landscape.

• Its Open Accessibility makes multiple outdoor recreational opportunities freely available to enjoy by many people in close proximity to Tucson.

• Its Road and Trail Network attracts a highly diverse range of motorized and non-motorized uses as well as access to more distant backcountry destinations.

Executive Summary of CAMP
Friends of Redington Pass convened a Collaborative Area Management Plan (CAMP) process for Redington Pass in 2014. That process brought together a diverse array of people who appreciate the Pass and want to assure it continues to provide multiple beneficial recreational opportunities while maintaining its unique back country environment. A broad range of user groups including hikers and mountain bikers, high clearance highway vehicles and all terrain vehicle riders and motor cyclists, conservationists, horseback riders, hunters and recreational target shooters, the area ranching permittee, and neighborhood associations and adjacent landowners came together to work on four major issue areas that were identified through extensive community scoping: recreational access, recreational target shooting, high use areas, and conflicts among users. 
 The CAMP recommendations are the result of over a year of study, deliberation, negotiation and consensus building by the CAMP working groups. A synthesis of these recommendations has been organized into five areas:
• Recreational Activities by Location (Western Slope, Central Plateau, Eastern Section);
• Enforcement;
• Services and Facilities;
• Orientation and Education; and
• Monitoring Conditions.
 Chief among the recommendations are: the strategy to enhance hiking and mountain biking opportunities along the Western Slope accessible to those with low-clearance vehicles; an adaptive management plan for both designated target shooting areas and dispersed shooting primarily in the Central Plateau of the Pass; maintenance of existing forest service roads and study of some additional connector loops; and improvements for parking, staging areas, signage and other needed services and infrastructure. Where possible, these recommendations come with suggestions for partnering and funding opportunities to assist the Forest Service in carrying out these recommendations.

The goal of this national program is twofold. First, it aims to address the problem of illiteracy in the local community (e.g., the problem size but also the impact it has on peoples' lives). Secondly, it encourages local stakeholders (e.g., aldermen, policymakers, civil servants, librarians, teachers, and volunteers) to work together in a network that attempts to combat illiteracy. 

This case study is situated in City A, a city with over 100.000 inhabitants, governed by a coalition government of multiple parties. The local network observed is one of the 35 networks involved in the national program 'Language for Life'. The main goal of the local organizations involved is to fight functional illiteracy among two different groups: Native Dutch speakers who never gain the literacy skills at school, immigrants who do not command Dutch language skills.

The stated ambitions are:
- to increase the coordination of the collaborative fight against illiteracy, in which the alderman (education, youth and health) of the municipality should take a leading role;
- to improve the guidance and training of illiterate people within the local community.
- to combat illiteracy in the local community.

The period observed covers just a few months (September 2018 - December 2018). The interviews were more of a snapshot of the collaboration at that point in time than a full review of its evolution over time.";3;6;Externally directed by law or authority;2;2;Off;3;3;2;3;4;4;Off;Off;4;Reasonably confident;"Before 2015, there were local initiatives around illiteracy, bringing together some of these parties. The local community college received national funding for literacy classes. After 2015, the local government was given control of these funds, deciding to dedicate 75% of the money to formal courses at the community college and 25% to informal courses by other local partners, such as the library or volunteer organizations. 

The local government used the new legal funding power to coordinate and streamline the collaboration. The respondents indicated that they experienced a lack of coordination previously, although they do not rate the coordination very highly at the time of the interviews either.

In this specific case, the following organizations are involved in the fight against illiteracy:
- the local government of City A (both the political and administrative sides of the organization); 
- the library, incl. 300 volunteers;
- the social service center 
- the regional community college
- the foundation Reading & Writing (in Dutch: Stichting Lezen & Schrijven, L&S);
- the employee insurance authority (in Dutch: Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen, UWV).

On the whole, these partners also rely on each to other to identify illiterate people (often by social service providers), offer formal training (community college), and informal support (library, volunteers). In practice, financial resources seem to be the main incentive to collaborate

The work of the library, social service center and municipality is closely intertwined due to the local government setting the budgets for the services of these two organizations. The municipality invites tenders for educational programs for both the Dutch native speakers and non-native speakers. One of the most important providers of these programs is the regional community college. The municipality of City A selected the specific community college to organize language courses for illiterate people within its local community and pays for the educational services provided. The role of the employee insurance agency was relatively active, with a particular employee working hard to make her colleagues aware of the role of illiteracy in unemployment.

There were no significant changes over time in the period observed.";6-okt;6-okt;6-okt;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;2;Off;2;2;2;2;Off;4;2;4;2;4;Off;2;Off;Mostly confident;"We observed  little to no ground rules of collaboration. There were some formal agreements between various stakeholders (i.e., municipality-library; municipality-social service center; municipality-local college). We did find some informal and implicit rules, such as that the employee insurance authority aimed to refer all clients who struggled with reading and writing to the local services.

Several of the organizations involved stated in interviews that they felt the ground rules of collaboration were missing. There were formal, bilateral funding contracts between the municipality and the respective parties, but little to no rules governing the multilateral collaboration as a whole.

In the period observed, there were no significant changes in the institutional architecture of collaboration.";Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;2;Off;2;2;Reasonably confident;"The leadership role within the collaboration was not well defined. The stakeholders involved took action on the various part for which they were responsible (see also question 31), but none of them took the overall leadership role. This gap caused unclarity about shared goals and intended results. 

The representatives of the municipality stated that they did not take the coordinating role in this collaboration, because they felt that other organizations (i.e., the library, the social service center and the community college) had to have some 'ownership' on this policy domain too. They feared that otherwise the municipality would be the only stakeholder to be held responsible for the combat of illiteracy within the local community. The other stakeholders, however, asked for more coordination and argued that the municipality was the organization designated to do so.

The stakeholders reported that the lack of leadership caused unclarity about the collaborative process and the shared goals and outcomes they were working on. One stakeholder developed a new approach on how to reach out to the target group (i.e., organizing fun activities and dinners for them), but most of them did not come up with new ideas on how to solve this societal problem.

There were no changes in the leadership dynamics in the period observed. However, the leadership role was discussed in the focus group and it turned out that stakeholders expected the municipality to take the lead in coordinating the collaborative process.";2;2;2;Off;2;2;2;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;2;Off;2;3;2;3;2;Off;Off;1;2;3;2;Off;Mostly confident;"The interviews showed that the various stakeholders that are active in combating illiteracy know about each other. Representatives of the organizations involved meet infrequently, partly due to the lack of an overall steering committee. Some of the stakeholders had experience with such a committee in a neighboring municipality and they were really enthusiastic about this.

Nothing much was said about joint fact finding or knowledge sharing (see also questions 40 and 41). However, what was mentioned are the so-called 'language ambassadors', which are persons who improved their reading and writing skills and now share their personal experiences with others. These ambassadors are frequently invited by the foundation Reading & Writing and the municipality to talk about their success stories.
No shared outcomes were explicitly formulated. Therefore, it was hard to indicate for the stakeholders whether objectives were achieved. Some of the respondents stated that they would like to formulate some shared goals and outcomes, because they expected that this will help them to convince other potential stakeholders to be involved in the fight against illiteracy as well. Others, however, argued that it is by definition hard to indicate the impact of reducing the number of illiterate people within the local community. In their opinion, it is almost impossible to conduct a pretest and a post-test to measure the outcomes of illiteracy policies. 

The process did not change over the period observed. ";1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;2;2;2;Off;3;3;3;2;2;2;Off;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;3;3;3;1;1;3;3;3;2;2;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"There were no shared goals articulated through statements of intent, memoranda or strategic plans. Thus, the goals of the collaboration were neither formulated nor monitored extensively. The alderman and civil servant responsible commented that most performance reporting looked more like 'school trip reports', only commenting that everything was going well and smoothly.

The library and the social service center also had to provide accounts (i.e., financial accounting) to the municipality. The municipality, and more specifically the alderman of Education, Youth and Social Work, were held accountable for policies and spending by the city council. The community college had to prove that it provided the educational programs that the municipality paid for. Furthermore, the programs of the community college needed to fulfill the quality standards of the Dutch Education Inspectorate, which can be categorized as an 'oversight body', although the illiteracy program would form only a small part of the Inspectorate's remit (see also question 51).

Three different kind of stakeholders had a monitoring influence on the collaboration: First, the alderman played an important part through allocating and monitoring the financial resources available. Secondly, the project manager of the foundation Reading & Writing monitored and intervened in the collaborative process on the combat of illiteracy, although she did not have an explicit mandate to do so. The main goal of this person was to make the local community aware of this societal problem and to promote collaborative action on solving this problem. The Foundation did publish yearly reviews of the illiterarcy rates across the country per municipality. Thirdly, the voluntary organizations involved also influenced the policy. Finally, there were a few spokespeople of formerly illiterate citizens - called language ambassadors- who were frequently asked to comment on the plans.

These dynamics did not change over the period observed.";2;2;2;Off;1;1;1;Off;2;2;2;Off;1;1;1;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;3;3;3;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Yes;3;3;3;3;3;3;4;4;4;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;2;2;2;Off;2;2;2;2;Off;Off;Off;4;3;4;2;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;;3;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;2;2;2;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Reasonably confident;"The output of the collaboration in terms of results produced by the collaborative governance process is difficult to determine. It turned out that there was no clear goal setting, and therefore it is impossible to measure whether the targets has been met in terms of outputs. Furthermore, there was no monitoring of the output of the collaborative governance process. 

The respondents could not provide a clear overview of the impact the collaboration had on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy so far. Again, there was no clear goal setting  nor monitoring of the outcomes of the collaborative governance process. Partners did comment on the success of the collaboration in the interviews and we also asked them to rate various performance aspects of the collaboration on a 1-5 scale, providing some information. This shows that partners were reasonably satisfied (average was 3.4 out of 5) with the number of people reached, although struggling to reach native Dutch speakers alongside the successes in reaching non-native Dutch speakers. The partners also marked a relatively high support among partners  for the approach, but little legitimacy and support beyond those immediately involved.

We did not found any changes to collective outputs over the period observed.

Secondly, it encourages local stakeholders (e.g., aldermen, policymakers, civil servants, librarians, teachers, and volunteers) to work together in a network that attempts to combat illiteracy. 

This case study is situated in City B, a city with over 55.000 inhabitants, governed by a coalition government of multiple parties. The local network emerged from existing partners engaged in the fight against illiteracy (library, community college) and new partners (local government, volunteers). The main goal of the local organizations involved is to fight functional illiteracy among two different groups: Native Dutch speakers who never gained the literacy skills at school, and immigrants who do not yet command Dutch language skills. The initiative was bolstered by a regional commitment to fighting illiteracy, to which the local alderman enthusiastically subscribed, endeavoring to boost the local network in his municipality.

On the short-term the stated ambitions are:
- to increase the coordination of the collaborative fight against illiteracy, in which the alderman (education, youth and social work) of the municipality should take a leading role;
- to improve the guidance and training of illiterate people within the local community;
- concretely, about 10% of the inhabitants struggled with illiteracy and the legislative council asked the alderman to reduce this by 1.5% every year. The alderman thought this goal was too specific and ambitious, although he welcomed the degree of commitment from the councillers.

The local government used its new funding powers to coordinate and streamline the collaboration. The respondents indicated that they experienced a lack of coordination before 2015, although they do not rate the coordination very highly at the time of the interviews either, remaining critical of some of the holes and misalignment in their joint approach .

The following organizations were involved in the fight against illiteracy:
- the local government of City B (both the political and administrative sides of the organization); 
- the library and its volunteers;
- a local voluntary organization;
- the social service center;

One of the most important providers of these programs is the regional community college. The municipality of City B selected the specific community college to organize language courses for illiterate people within its local community and pays for the educational services provided. The role of the employee insurance agency is very limited. Its employees are made aware of the possibility to refer illiterate people to the local services on illiteracy. There was no significant incentive found for the agency to do so, although theoretically boosting language skills should enable job seekers to secure employment.

There were no significant changes over time in the period observed.";6-okt;6-okt;6-okt;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;2;Off;2;2;2;2;Off;4;4;4;4;4;Off;4;Off;Reasonably confident;"The institutional design of the collaboration was divided across three layers: A steering committee - consisting of the alderman, lead civil servant, community college representative, library manager, volunteer agency president, welfare agency director, and Reading & Writing Foundation project leader - met about every two months to oversee the initiatives. A working group of a dozen or so implementation partners met regularly to discuss operational issues. The implementation network counted a further 40+ organizations, schools, volunteer groups, and other parties who ran initiatives supporting the overall program.

Little to no ground rules of collaboration were explicated. There were a handful of formal bilateral agreements between various stakeholders (i.e., municipality-library; municipality-social service center; municipality-community college), but there was no multi-lateral illiteracy contract or pact. Most of the organizations involved stated that they felt the ground rules of collaboration were missing or unclear. The alderman stated that he wanted to avoid formalizing the organization to not make it too bureaucratic and turn the collaboration in a race towards getting the largest share of public funding.

The collaborative forum(s) seemed to be inclusive: various stakeholders (i.e., political, public, and non-profit organizations) involved in the fight against illiteracy (see also question 21c), with a cross-section of the different organization represented in the working group and steering committee as well.

Furthermore, the stakeholders involved took action on the various parts for which they were responsible (see also question 31), and therefore there was to some extent a sense of 'shared ownership' on this policy domain.

The stakeholders involved were positive about the role the alderman and policy officer in leading the collaboration, specifically because they were able to keep the fight against functional illiteracy on the political agenda.  Stakeholders also reported a sense of 'shared ownership', which had a positive effect on the collaborative process and the shared goals and outcomes they were working on. However, the collective responsibility was found wanting when one of the key partners, the library project leader, retired and the role was not filled for two months. During those two months, the local government complained that not one of the parties stepped up to fill her place, while the community college argued that the local government had not provided funds to address this gap.

There were no changes in the leadership dynamics in the period observed.

The frequent meetings relied strongly on the effort of some key stakeholders such as the municipality and library, with other parties taking a more instrumental approach to the collaboration and focusing on their particular interest.

The municipality and its partners aimed to reach out to 1.5% of the 10% illiterate people in the local community. According to some of the stakeholders, this desired outcome was too ambitious to realize within the set period of time. However, they liked that the municipality developed a policy on illiteracy which underlined the importance of this societal issues. The experts from the library and community college, however, mentioned that it is fundamentally challenging to assess the reduction of illiteracy within the local community. The testing is difficult and finding illiterate people is always challenging.

However, the national Reading & Writing Foundation marked City B as an example of relatively high performance in the illiteracy policy domain.

The respondents could not provide a clear overview of the impact the collaboration has had on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy so far. Partners did comment positively on the performance of the collaboration in the interviews. They were also asked them to rate various performance aspects of the collaboration on a 1-5 scale, providing some information. This shows that partners were reasonably satisfied (average was 3.2 out of 5) with the number of people reached, although they struggled to reach native Dutch speakers (average 2.8 out of 5) alongside the success in reaching non-native Dutch speakers (average 3.5 out of 5). The partners also noted a relatively high support among partners  for the approach (average 3.7 out of 5). These judgments may have been lowered by the high ambitions of the participants; they were doing well according to national experts, but local partners wanted to achieve much more.

In 2014, the national program 'Language for Life', initiated by the non-profit Reading & Writing Foundation and funded by the Dutch Ministery of Education, Culture and Science, started to support municipalities, public-sector organizations, educators, and volunteers to participate in a local network that focuses on the combat of functional illiteracy. The goal of this national program is twofold. First, it aims to address the problem of illiteracy in the local community (e.g., the problem size but also the impact it has on peoples' lives). Secondly, it encourages local stakeholders (e.g., aldermen, policymakers, civil servants, librarians, teachers, and volunteers) to work together in a network that attempts to combat illiteracy. 

This case study is situated in City C, a city with over 90.000 inhabitants, governed by a coalition government of multiple parties. The main goal of the local organizations involved is to fight functional illiteracy among two different groups: Native Dutch speakers who did not gain sufficient literacy skills at school, and immigrants who do not yet read Dutch. In reaching this goal they aim to develop a project plan for they see the necessity of finding new ways to tackle this societal problem. Currently, they experience a lack of budget, which is seen as one of the major organizational issues the collaboration faces.

(b) The stated ambitions and desired outputs and outcomes.
On the short-term the stated ambitions are:
- to provide appropriate courses for both the native and non-native Dutch speakers;
- to define which stakeholder is (to what extent) responsible for what task in the collective fight against illiteracy.
On the long-term the stated ambitions are:
- to combat illiteracy in the local community;
- to enable people to participate fully in society;
- to reduce poverty in the local community.
There were no further concrete outputs and outcomes mentioned.

(c) Evolution of these challenges, issues and ambitions during the period observed.
The period observed covers just a few months (October 2018 - March 2019). The interviews were more of a snapshot of the collaboration at that point in time than a full review of its evolution over time.";3;6;Externally directed by law or authority;2;2;Off;4;Off;2;4;3;3;Off;Off;3;Mostly confident;"(a) The prehistory and past interactions of participants
There were already local initiatives around illiteracy, mainly organized by the local social service center. This public organization was and is funded by the local government. Before 2015, the local community college received national funding for literacy classes. Thereafter, the local government was given control of these funds, and took the lead in bringing together various partners that aim to fight against illiteracy (see c). However, the local social service center and local government played and still play a major role in the fight against illiteracy within the local community. 

(b) How the collaboration was initiated
The local government used the new legal funding power to attempt to coordinate and streamline the collaboration. The respondents indicated that they experienced a lack of coordination previously, although they do not rate the coordination highly at the time of the interviews either.

(c) The sense of interdependence between participants and the incentives to collaborate
In this specific case, the following organizations are involved in the fight against illiteracy:
- the local government of City C (both the political and administrative sides of the organization); 
- the library and its volunteers;
- a local voluntary organization;
- the social service center;
- the regional community college;
- the foundation Reading & Writing (in Dutch: Stichting Lezen & Schrijven, L&S);
- the employee insurance authority (in Dutch: Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen, UWV).

Interdependence
The library, the social service center and the municipality are closely related. This is due to the fact that the local government sets the budgets for the services of these two organizations, which seems to be their main incentive to participate in this collaboration. Besides, the municipality invites tenders for educational programs for both the  Dutch native speakers and non-Dutch speakers. One of the most important providers of these programs is the regional community college. The municipality of City B selected the specific community college to organize language courses for illiterate people within its local community, and thus pays for the educational services provided. Again, financial resources seem to be the main incentive to collaborate. 

The foundation Reading & Writing is financed by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. However, the main objective of L&S is to provide programs that will help to reduce the number of illiterated people in the Netherlands. This policy goal seems to be its incentive to collaborate with local partners. Finally, the role of the employee insurance authority is very limited. Its employees are made aware of the possibility to refer illiterate people to the local services on illiteracy. There was no significant incentive found for the UWV to do so.

(d) Any significant changes over time in the period observed
There were no significant changes over time in the period observed.";6-okt;6-okt;6-okt;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;3;Off;3;2;2;2;Off;4;2;4;2;4;Off;2;Yes;Not very confident;"(a) The ground rules of the collaboration were generally implicit and unclear. The key players central to the collaboration (e.g. local government) knew who was responsible for what, but other players lacked this overview. To many stakeholders it was unclear how tasks were divided or meant to be divided.

(b/c) The inclusiveness and transparency of the collaborative forum
The collaborative forum(s) seems to be relatively inclusive. Various different stakeholders (i.e., political, public, and non-profit organizations) were involved in the fight against illiteracy (see also question 21c). However, the exact demarcation of these forums was also left implicuit.

(d) Any significant changes in the institutional architecture of collaboration over time
In the period observed, there were no significant changes in the institutional architecture of collaboration.";Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;3;Off;3;3;Mostly confident;"(a) The form and style of leadership within the collaboration
The overall leadership role was in the hands of the representatives of the municipality (i.e., alderman and policy officers). However, most partners reported there was no clear or strong leadership from the local government. The stakeholders involved were positive about the collaboration, because they were able to find each other in their collective fight against functional illiteracy. Furthermore, the stakeholders involved took action on the various separate parts for which they were responsible (see also question 31).

(b) The dynamics and impact of leadership on the collaborative process
The representatives of the municipality played an important leading role in the collaboration. One of their roles was that at least some recurring meetings were held, although not on a regular basis. As a result, various stakeholders frequently met each other. Several respondents indicated that this was one of the strengths of the collaborative process in city C. However, the leadership role of the local government would be weakened when the coordinating civil servant was busy with other dossiers, with no other partners picking up the slack.

(c) Changes in the leadership dynamics in the period observed
There were no changes in the leadership dynamics in the period observed. ";3;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;3;3;2;Off;2;3;3;3;3;Off;Off;3;2;3;3;Off;Reasonably confident;"(a) The collaborative process in terms of how the actors interacted with each other
The interviews showed that the various stakeholders that are active in combating illiteracy know each other. Representatives of some of the organizations involved come together frequently in bilateral or sub-group meetings. There was some limited investment in joint fact finding and knowledge sharing. A key role was given to so-called 'language ambassadors'; persons who improved their reading and writing skills and now share their personal experiences with others. These ambassadors are often invited to talk about their success stories.

(b) How they formulated and achieved shared outcomes
The respondents were unclear about how they formulated and achieved shared quick wins (i.e., short-term outputs). However, they had formulated tangible, strategic outcomes. The desired strategic outcomes were reducing illiteracy - and thereby poverty - within the local community. No insights were given in how to achieve these outcomes.

(c) How the process changed over the period observed
The process did not change over the period observed. ";2;2;2;Off;2;2;2;Off;3;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;4;4;4;Off;1;1;1;Off;Off;3;3;3;Off;Off;3;3;3;2;2;2;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"(a) How the goals of the collaboration were formulated and monitored
Some respondents mentioned a strategic plan that at the moment of data collection still had to be developed. For now, it was unclear how the goals of the collaboration were formulated and monitored. 

(b) How participants, elected officials, oversight bodies and citizens held the collaboration to account

Accountability
The library and the social service center had to provide accounts (i.e., financial accounting) to the municipality. The municipality, and more specifically the alderman of Youth, Education and Health can be held accountable for policies and spending by the city council. The community college had to prove that it provided the educational programs that the municipality paid for. Thus, the elected official played an important part in rendering account of the collaboration (see also question 51). Furthermore, the programs of the community college needed to fulfill the quality standards of the Dutch Education Inspectorate, which can be categorized as an 'oversight body', although the illiteracy program would form only a small part of the Inspectorate's remit (see also question 51).

Influence
Different kind of stakeholders had influence on the collaboration. First, the alderman played an important part for this person allocated the financial resources available. Secondly, several policy officers supported the collaborative process on the combat of illiteracy. The main goal of them was to promote collaborative action on solving this problem. Thirdly, the social service center, the library and the voluntary organization involved also influenced the policy. Fourthly, the local project leader of the national Reading & Writing Foundation would monitor the local practices and results in comparison to national indicators and patterns. Finally, there were a few spokespeople of (formerly) illiterate citizens who were frequently asked to comment on the plans.

(c) How these dynamics changed over the period observed.
These dynamics did not change over the period observed.";3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;2;2;2;Off;Off;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;1;1;1;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Yes;2;2;2;2;2;2;3;3;3;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;3;3;1;1;1;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;;4;4;4;3;3;3;Off;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;2;2;2;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"(a) The output of the collaboration in terms of results produced by the collaborative governance process
The output of the collaboration in terms of results produced by the collaborative governance process is difficult to determine. Nothing was mentioned about monitoring the results of the collaborative process and no recent evaluation report has been published on the outputs.

(b) The outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences
The respondents could not provide a clear overview of the impact the collaboration has had on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy so far. There were some numbers available of the output and reach of the program, but it remained hard to gauge the overall imact. 

Stakeholders did provide their own evaluation of the  collaboration in a survey, measuring success on a 1-5 scale. This shows that they were mostly dissatisfied (average was 2.9 out of 5) with the number of people reached, chiefly because they were struggling to reach native Dutch speakers (average was 1.8 out of 5). The stakeholders  also marked a relatively low awareness among the clients of the various programs on offer (average was 2.2 out of 5).

Notable successes were seen in developing innovative course models which attracted more participants. For example, course providers overcame the shame among illiterate citizens by offering camouflaged courses (e.g. sold as computer or tax application courses), which actually helped people deal with their language difficulties as well.

(c) The changes to collective outputs and social outcomes over time
We did not find any changes to collective outputs and social outcomes over the period observed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The societal challenge that the team under study faced was 'disrupting the criminal hemp industry' (Cels et al., 2018, p.2). The team members reformulated this challenge into 'combating illegal grow houses that can cause a fire hazard in residential neighborhoods' (Idem, p.4). In short, the prevention of domestic fires as a result of illegal drug practices thus became the societal challenge.

The various organizations involved (i.e., national police, public prosecution service, tax authority, municipality of Breda and regional energy provider) were willing to provide support and capacity, as long as their interests were taken into account. The main problem then was that they appeared to have diverging interests. For example, the police and the municipality were planning a large-scale campaign in Breda to fight against organized crime within the local community. The public prosecution service and the tax authority, by contrast, preferred to take on more serious criminals. Finally, the regional energy provider had no interest in fighting organized crime at all; they were in it for safety issues (much less financial issues, as initially expected by others). The major challenge was thus to bridge the differences between the various organizations involved (p.2).

 (b) The stated ambitions and desired outputs and outcomes
The team was part of the Organized Crime Field Lab 2015-2016 (in short, OCFL 2015-2016). This experiential learning environment is a joint project of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service, the Dutch National Police and the universities of Tilburg/Harvard/Oxford. Teams participating in the OCFL 2015-2016 were challenged to develop and design creative and innovative solutions for various forms of organized crime with subversive effects. The stated ambition of the team under study was: 'combating illegal grow houses that can cause a fire hazard in residential neighborhoods' (Idem, p.4).

 (c) How these challenges, issues and ambitions evolved during the period observing
As described above, the societal challenge was reformulated: a shift from 'disrupting the criminal hemp industry' (Idem, p.2) to 'combating illegal grow houses that can cause a fire hazard in residential neighborhoods' (Idem, p.4). This was done to align the diverging interests of the various organizations involved, and to arrive at a problem definition that all parties could support (Idem, p.2).

Before the kick-off session of the OCFL 2015-2016, the participants had not met each other and thus had no prehistory or past interactions (Cels et al., 2018, p.1). 

(b) How the collaboration was initiated
Direct supervisors of the participants, together with members of a dedicated task force 'Organized crime', had crafted a problem description for the collaboration as part of the OCFL 2015-2016. They decided which professionals were part of the collaboration. They selected a police man, a public prosecutor, a tax officer, a policy officer of the Municipality of Breda and a manager of the regional energy provider. Their proposal focused on drug crimes in the two southern provinces of the Netherlands (i.e., Noord-Brabant and Limburg). Therefore, all participants selected were working for an organization located in either Noord-Brabant or Limburg (Idem, pp.1-2).

(c) The sense of interdependence between participants and the incentives to collaborate
The participants had no sense of interdependence at the beginning of their collaborative project. Each of them had his* own ideas on how to approach the problem. For example, the police man and the policy officer of the Municipality of Breda aimed for a large-scale operation at the local level. However, for the public prosecutor and the tax officer, this local focus was irrelevant for they were responsible for the fight against organized crime, notably committed by serious criminals, at a regional level. Furthermore, the manager of the regional energy provider was not interested in crime fighting at all. In short, the participants had different ideas and interests. They tackled this by reframing the societal challenge (see also 13a). This increased both the sense of interdependence with regard to the reframed problem and the incentives to collaborate.

(d) Any significant changes over time in the period observed
The most remarkable change was the growing trust among the various participants and their ability to find mutually acceptable solutions to the societal challenge they aimed to tackle (see also 13a).

In the beginning of the process, it turned out that the various partners had diverging interests. The participants therefore had to change their societal challenge to ensure that all of them could add something to the collaborative project. Later on, two other important partners were invited to join the operation, namely the local government (in particular the mayor) and the local fire brigade. As a result, the collaborative forum became more inclusive (Idem, pp.8-9). 

No significant changes in the institutional architecture of the collaboration were observed over time (Cels et al., 2018, pp.1-17).

The participants started the process with articulating their own ideas and interests. Because of this, it took some time before they had a shared understanding of the societal challenge (Cels et al., 2018, pp.2-3). However, after a few discussion sessions they had a shared problem definition and were able to start with developing solutions for this problem (Idem, pp.3-4). In sum, the participants first had their own ideas about the problem they aimed to tackle, and later on they listened to each other's ideas and developed a shared understanding (Idem, pp.3-4).

(b) How they formulated and achieved shared outcomes
In their search for a shared understanding of the societal challenge, they collected insights into the nature and the scope of the problem (i.e., production of drugs in the southern provinces of the Netherlands) and the ways in which the law enforcement authorities had approached this problem (e.g., previous actions against such crime). The participants shared their knowledge on these two issues (i.e., problem and solution) and looked for new ways to approach the problem (Idem, p.5). In doing so, they aimed for an experiment in which they could test their new approach, which was a combination of prevention (i.e., inform citizens of the risks of grow houses, and thereby attempting to increase societal support en informal capacity) and repression (i.e., to prosecute serious drug criminals).

(c) How the process changed over the period observed
After formulating a shared problem definition and developing a collective approach to tackle this problem, the participants had to get support from their own organizations for this idea. This turned out to be more challenging than they had expected, because every organization had its own interests (see also 13a en 21c). As a result, the participants had to redevelop their approach in order to keep all participants committed (Idem, p.6).

A first experiment was carried out soon after reformulating the societal challenge (see also 13a) and redeveloping the collective approach (see also 47b). This experiment aimed to stop:
- hemp-related fires in residential neighborhoods;
- illegal drugs practices in residential neighborhoods ; and,
- exploitation of vulnerable citizens (Idem, p.6).

In addition, the collaborative approach was divided into four different steps:
1. The regional energy provider measured the electricity consumption in the residential neighborhoods under investigation and shared this information with the other participants;
2. The local police, the local fire brigade and the policy officers of the Municipality of Breda organized and coordinated a two-day operation in the neighborhoods under investigation;
3. Before and during the operation, the neighborhood councils distributed information about the danger of hemp-related fires;
4. After the operation, the participants organized an information market to evaluate the operation with citizens of the concerned neighborhoods (Idem, pp.6-7).

(b) How the participants, elected officials, oversight bodies, and citizens' held the collaboration to account
The collaboration had to inform participating organizations and citizens of the concerned neighborhoods (and beyond) about their operation (Idem, pp.6-7). The original case description, however, gave little information on how the collaboration was held accountable (Idem, pp.1-17). 

(c) How these dynamics changed over the period observing
A major change in the group dynamics was the shift from promoting their own ideas to listening to each other's ideas. As a result of this change in the dynamics, they were able to formulate a shared problem definition and to develop a collective approach to tackle this problem (Idem, pp.2-7). Furthermore, they were willing to invite other relevant organizations (i.e., the local government and the local fire brigade) to join their two-day operation (Idem, pp.8-9).

The outputs of the first experiment (see also 54a) were:
1. Reduction of grow houses in the neighborhood: two grow houses were found;
2. First experiences with collaborative governance process: various public and private organizations worked together;
3. First experiences with a new communication strategy: citizens of concerned neighborhoods were well-informed about the operation (Cels et al., 2018, pp.10-11).

(b) The outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences
The following three lessons for follow-up operations can be seen as the outcomes of the first experiment:
1. Smaller scale: too much households were involved in the experiment;
2. Lower costs: the material costs of the operation were relatively high;
3. Clearer frame: local press and others did not always fully grasp the frame (i.e., promoting fire safety vs. fighting against organized crime) (Idem, pp.10-11).

(c) The changes to collective outputs and social outcomes over time
After the first experiment, the participants hoped to undertake similar collaborative operations in other neighborhoods. The individual team members promoted their innovative idea, but found out that most local governments were not so willing to follow their newly developed approach. The so-called 'road show' took the team members a lot of time and energy, but they felt that too little was achieved. After two years, they discontinued the 'road show', and thereby also with their collaborative project (Idem, pp.13-14). To be sure: members of the collaboration did continue with elements of the approach, and members kept in touch, but the collaboration as such ceased to exist.

The centre’s disuse and decline occurred due to a contracting local manufacturing sector, poor past planning decisions (i.e. shopping mall in the same centre) and the rapid suburbanisation of neighbouring municipalities. 

b) The Victorian Government embarked on the “Revitalising Central Dandenong” (2005-2025) (RCD hereafter) project in an attempt to restore the “standing” Central Dandenong once had as the capital of Melbourne’s south east through “job-creating economic activity,” delivering 4,000 new homes and bringing new residents to the centre, and improving local infrastructure and amenities over twenty years. Revitalisation was planned to recognise the multicultural character of the neighbourhood. In terms of the governance ambitions, RCD was designed to support collaboration between local and regional actors across public, civil society and private sectors. 

c) The desired social and economic outcomes of RCD are largely on track to be fulfilled. In 2016 there were more jobs (aprox. 2000) and more residents (aprox. 1000) in the centre, commercial and residential developments increased (over AUS$300,000,000 in investment between 2006 and 2011), and local infrastructure has been upgraded or built (e.g. public library, produce market, theatre, central square, bridge, green space). Deakin University opened a local centre, while Chisholm Institute (a Technical and Further Education college - TAFE) continued to deliver courses for local job insertion. New public spaces that recognise cultural diversity were created (i.e. Harmony Square, Afgan Bazaar and Little India Cultural Precincts) and new community activities have been organised. While there are measurable improvements in public realm infrastructure and the percentage of people engaged in work or study was higher in 2016 than in 2006, the area still faces challenges, including a lack of affordable housing, the rising cost of commercial rents, dwindling services for refugees and asylum seekers, ongoing high (relative) crime rates as well as one of the lowest employment participation rates of Melbourne. 
Revitalisation has to date occurred through the active participation of a broad range of actors that has changed over time. The early phase (2006-2010) was led by the Victorian Government’s development agency in partnership with the City of Greater Dandenong. The middle period (2011-2015) was marked by the near total retreat of the development agency, the growing leadership of the local government and the activation of local networks. The role of local cultural and retail associations as well as the creation of the private sector lobby group the Committee for Dandenong stand out in this period. The latter period of the project (2016-present, though only 2016 was part of this study) represents the continuation of the middle period, with early signs of renewed involvement by the Victorian Government in revitalisation efforts. Collaboration modes have evolved accordingly throughout, with increasing local actor involvement. Overall, while temporary institutional structures have functioned to provide basic support for operational matters, collaboration has occurred primarily in an informal and ad hoc way between different actors.";4;4;Externally directed by law or authority;2;2;Off;4;4;2;4;5;4;Off;Off;4;Highly confident;"a) Prior to the introduction of RCD, the Dandenong Development Board (Board) was established (2003) to address the growing issue of urban decline identified since the mid-1990s. The board was made up of nine people including local representatives (Mayor, CEO), state representatives (from the Departments of Infrastructure, Industry/Innovation) and two persons with business interests in Dandenong. The Board, just like the ensuing RCD project, was subject to the direction and control of the Minister of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP). Local actors involved in the revitalisation process interacted in other ways prior to the introduction of RCD, for example on local committees and boards (e.g. involved with the hospital or TAFE), in organising community events or on a sporadic basis for individual project and policies. 

b) When RCD was announced in 2005, the state’s development agency was given a mandate to undertake the project with two partners:
1. Victorian Government departments (DELWP; Premier and Cabinet; and Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources); and
2. The City of Greater Dandenong (local government).
During the early period of RCD (2006-2010), cross-government coordination occurred formally through the Project Control Group (PCG). 
Following the early period of mandated collaboration between key actors (post-2010), revitalisation has been led more by the local government and has occurred through single projects initiated by the City. Some of these local projects were introduced as a result of funding opportunities offered by the State Government (e.g. rail upgrades, Little India designation) or Federal Government (i.e. through the 2011 economic stimulus package). New forms of collaboration at the local level, for example between private businesses with the creation of the Committee for Dandenong, between traders at the Dandenong Market or in designating and delivering new programs for interfaith learning by religious leaders also emerged during this period. These new platforms or networks for collaboration were stimulated by the initial investment made in revitalisation (2006-2010) and receive some form of support by local government, from access to information or services to community grants and ongoing funding.

c) The sense of interdependence between actors relates to the recognition that each relies on others for revitalisation to occur and that revitalisation is in the best interest of all. Regional and local governments rely closely on each other for funding as well as for operational purposes, for example for the local library. Civil society relies on government funding to provide services, such as English language classes, and vice versa. Private businesses rely on governments to fund infrastructure projects that support their operation. The incentives to collaborate relate to the level of interest of each participant in the revitalisation process and occur primarily in an unstructured and informal way, though formal structures may temporarily exist to address particular issues.

d) Collaborative structures set up to support vertical and horizontal collaboration between government agencies were functional during the early part of the project, however they did not lead to any significant changes over time in terms of cross-government collaboration. The most significant lasting changes in terms of collaboration have occurred in the latter stages of revitalisation with stronger local networks and partnerships. ";6-okt;nov-15;nov-15;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;2;Off;2;2;3;3;Off;3;2;3;2;3;Off;2;Off;Mostly confident;"a) Throughout the period observed (2006-2016), collaboration has occurred in a highly fluid and informal way that relies more on the strength of interpersonal relationships than systemised processes. Interviewees discussed the importance of the close working relationships between leaders, in particular that many were embedded in the community long-term and that these individuals’ soft skills engendered flexible and responsive collaboration. At times, committees and boards have been established to support actor interaction.
In particular, the first period of RCD was managed through the PCG. The Victorian Auditor-General found however that it did not operate with “codified procedures, responsibilities and accountabilities for individual agencies” (2011, p.12) and actions were certainly “largely ad hoc (and) informal” (2011, p.13). In later phases, specific initiatives have been supported by organised collaboration with comparatively clear principles and processes. Some of these are lasting, such as the committee of retailers from the Dandenong Market which operates with clear ground rules, from the election of members managed by the Australian Electoral Commission to the organisation of regular meetings and clear channels of communication with the Market Board. Another collaboration is the Interfaith Network of the City of Greater Dandenong which brings together leaders from over twenty faith communities monthly to share experiences. Their principles of involvement include co-participation in the Network’s activities, for example informing government on relevant policy issues (disability, domestic violence), participating in the tours of places of worship (e.g. for school children, the police), faith ceremonies and community events (e.g. Talking Faith Forums in libraries).

b) & c) Collaboration has largely been informal throughout and complemented by two distinct phases of organised approaches. The mandated interjurisdictional coordination with community consultation that occurred in the initial phase (2006-2010) focused on the general theme of revitalisation. While functional for issue monitoring and some aspects of project administration, there were tensions between departments on some issues, such as transport decisions, and difficulties in managing the vertical integration of local and regional governments due to strong imbalances, (e.g. City was required to cede planning powers to the state and was not privy to all financial information). In this regard, some of the core project decision-making were not widely transparent. The Auditor-General’s review of RCD (2011) claimed formal cross-government coordination was “inconsistent” (p.ix) and the reliance on informal approaches did not “promote accountability for actions” (p.9) and “lacked transparency” (p.12). During the later phases of the project, collaboration has continued to be based on strong interpersonal relationships and occurs in an organised way for numerous single issue policy initiatives or individual projects. Our research suggests many of these are lasting, inclusive and transparent within each specific, often single-issue forum. 

d) Temporary structures were established to deal with key operational issues during the early phase of RCD, though these were largely eliminated in 2010 and therefore did not leave lasting changes to internal institutional architecture. The greatest change has been activating and strengthening local networks since 2010, including increasing sophistication in the way governments engage with these organised business and community groups.";Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;4;4;4;Off;5;5;5;Off;5;5;5;Off;2;Off;3;3;Highly confident;"a) & b) The form and style of leadership was critical in shaping the style of collaboration. As one interviewee described, it was driven through “a leader-set culture, not bits of paper.” Collaboration was essentially leader-oriented and based on the strength of personal relationships between key actors both in the beginning (2005-2010) with the Victorian Government’s development agency leading the process and later in the project life with the local government taking on the leadership role (2011-onwards). The impact of this style of leadership and collaboration was effective for swift project initiation and definition as well as for focused project delivery purposes. While functional, drawbacks were identified in terms of wider inclusion of diverse perspectives, for example in identifying problems (e.g. car-parking and traffic issues were an unresolved concern for many local businesses in 2016 and 2017, some suggesting low-level interaction with the retail sector as an issue in the project) or for creative problem-resolution. It also created scope for missed opportunities because of the absence of a range of actors. For example, this was true in the RCD project in terms of seed-funding initiatives in the education sector as well as health as these areas of government were not involved as key actors in the project. When leadership was discussed by interview respondents it was often as the antidote to the absence of larger and formal collaborative forums.

c) The most significant change to the leadership dynamics in the process of revitalisation occurred as a result of a change of administration in 2010. The new Victorian Government repurposed the government’s development agency and the project team went from 25 to one person in 2011. This change was disruptive, though not terminal for the project given that most of the investment and major decisions about the direction of revitalisation had been made. It led to a swift and unplanned transfer of leadership from the state’s development agency to the local government. It also prompted local business leaders to become more organised. This is best represented through the creation of the Committee for Dandenong, run by a board of seven local business leaders who developed Strategic Agenda (2015) for the region that sets out priorities for local development. The Committee uses this to articulate joint priorities for local businesses and advocate for continued public investment in revitalisation. As the revitalisation process matured, many existing interactions between local government and community and retail groups have also become more sophisticated through formal collaborative structures. One example of this is the creation of the Dandenong Market Pty Ltd in 2012 with an independent board and committee of traders that manage the City’s market to deliver a financial return for government as well as deliver social responsibilities, including to nurture new businesses and host community and cultural festivals. Prior to this the market was run by a real estate agency without participation in the Market’s planning by local community or traders. Another example of growing community leadership supported by local government is the Interfaith Network mentioned above. The growing leadership role of organised non-government groups also reflects a trend towards greater outsourcing of community services by government. ";3;4;4;Off;5;3;2;Off;2;2;2;Off;2;4;4;Off;3;4;4;Off;4;5;5;5;4;Off;Off;4;4;5;4;Off;Mostly confident;"a), b) & c). The collaborative process behind revitalisation in Central Dandenong can be broken into three main phases. An early phase mandated by the Parliament of Victoria to support the initiation of RCD (2005-2010), a middle phase (2011-2015) defined by a significant change in custodianship of revitalisation s from the state to local government as well as the invigoration of local stakeholder networks and a third phase in which some local networks show signs of consolidating their roles (2016-present, though the research observation ended in 2016). These periods coincide with changes in the Victorian Government’s administration and relatively strong changes to policy focus each time.
The first phase of collaboration was defined largely by the leadership role of the Victorian Government in initiating RCD. The formal structure for collaboration was the PCB which met monthly to identify project priorities and issues, oversee community engagement as well as to track progress and meet reporting requirements. However, the PCB was found to be “weak” in ensuring “cross-government coordination” by the Victorian Auditor General (2011, p.8-9) due to unclear responsibilities, accountabilities and processes. It was the interaction between key actors that occurred largely outside of this forum in an informal and sporadic way that served as the real operational backbone for revitalisation, including how shared outcomes were formulated and achieved. The following respondent exemplifies this sentiment, commenting that the project “…relied on the likes of (certain people) knowing who the decision-makers were within government, knowing how to get to them, have influence and how to get the decisions made…the fact that we had very capable individuals at the coalface meant that you could overcome a number of the hurdles that you invariably face in these projects…Of course in a perfect scenario, you've got a good structure and you've got great people doing the project. You’ve got both. But if you can only have one of those, great people will win every time, because they'll find a way.” Despite the highly functional nature of this approach there were downfalls in this phase of the project in terms of procedural delays, risks identified by government in financial management and missed opportunities for collaboration, especially in the areas of health and education. 
By 2011 the state’s development agency provided only minor oversight of the RCD program while the local government assumed leadership responsibilities for revitalisation. Collaboration processes initiated by the City occur for specific policy issues or projects, for example the new library or the Afghan Bazaar Cultural Precinct. Each initiative is different, though goals tend to be co-developed between local government and stakeholder groups (e.g. cultural groups, retailers). Any policy changes or public works are undertaken by government (or outsourced to contractors), though the operation of new facilities or delivery of services may be government, non-government or co-delivered depending on the case (increasingly less by government as the shift from government-as-provider to government-as-purchaser matures). The second phase can also be defined by intensified collaboration between community leaders and between local business leaders (see Interfaith Network and Committee for Dandenong examples above). Our research indicates that many of the focused collaborative structures are consolidating their roles and providing more sophisticated responses to the challenges they identify.";5;5;5;Off;4;4;4;Off;1;2;2;Off;3;3;3;2;5;1;Off;Off;2;3;3;Off;3;3;3;Off;2;3;3;3;2;2;2;4;4;2;3;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"a) In the initial phase, collaboration was mandated and the PCG tasked with delivering “a whole-of-government approach, and for overseeing, monitoring and holding accountable all working groups and agencies with direct delivery responsibility” (Victorian Auditor-General’s Office, 2011, p.4). These goals were monitored through two different review processes undertaken by the Victorian Government in 2008 and 2011. The Auditor-General’s review in 2011 stated that the PCB had “not become the robust decision-making forum intended” and reported little evidence that the group effectively governed or monitored RCD (p.10). In the absence of codified procedures to formulate or monitor goals for collaboration, the formal PCG functioned to address problems as they arose and meet administrative requirements. As described above, collaboration has occurred throughout the project in an ad hoc and informal way without clear processes on goal formulation or monitoring. During later phases of revitalisation, goals have been formulated and monitored mostly by the City’s different departments (e.g. Community Services, Business, and Planning) in consultation with affected actors with a focus on single issues or specific projects, or externally between members of community or business networks. 

b) During the first phase of RCD, collaboration was seen as necessary for revitalisation and was measured as functional though not well-organised for this goal. Cross-government coordination during the first phase was assessed as inadequate in reviews by oversight bodies. The response provided by the development agency was that weak formal governance arrangements “should not be confused or overshadow the progress that has occurred in Central Dandenong due to the efforts of all parties involved” (correspondence VicUrban, 2011). While several attempts were made to change and strengthen formal governance structures, informal ad hoc approaches prevailed. Given the informal nature of collaboration it was not held accountable to outside parties such as citizens, elected officials or oversight bodies. Interviewees in our research suggested that it was the “relational aspect” of the part of the project expressed through “goodwill and unofficial conversations” as well as the “soft skills of individuals” gave the revitalisation process “traction and effectiveness”. Later in the process of revitalisation the mechanisms of holding to account the different collaborations vary. Where the City convenes an initiative they tend to unfold in a consultative way with opportunities to provide feedback, though the decision-making powers remain with government and some influence by elected officials managed by public servants. Where collaboration occurs between members of the community or businesses, goals are formulated among members, performance is measured internally by members and changes are made to their processes and goals by members without external accounting, with the exception of reporting back to government when funding is granted. 

c) The change in collaboration went from highly informal and oriented towards delivery of the Victorian Government’s RCD to focused on locally-led individual projects with continued emphasis on interpersonal relationships in the coordination of different aspects of revitalisation. We observed consolidation in specific collaborative approaches and increasing sophistication in inter-organisational/group interactions in the later phases of revitalisation.

First, it supported the refinement of project details to match shared desired outcomes and delivery capacities. Second, collaboration served to address implementation hurdles through the formal PCB and informal discussions, such as in negotiating traffic planning requirements. Lastly, formal collaboration served to deliver administrative requirements, including shared project reporting. The outputs of collaboration in the later phases are varied. Outside of government they range from the creation of a Strategic Agenda by business leaders through the Committee for Dandenong (2015) to the definition of formal programs to support interfaith understanding as described above. Results in City-led collaborations are varied, for example the refinement of public space projects (e.g. pop-up park, Harmony Square) and the formal identification of two cultural precincts: the Afghan Bazaar and Little India. 
b) During the first phase, the outcomes of collaboration in terms of the impact on problem solving were fast though not always inclusive. At a number of critical junctures opportunities were missed to strengthen and diversify the revitalisation process due to the relatively narrow group of actors involved. Nevertheless, participants in our research highlighted the effectiveness of personal relationships for collaborative problem-solving of operational issues.
Project goals are on track to be fulfilled due principally to the ongoing government funding for revitalisation. Collaboration has been required to deliver revitalisation. While legitimacy was not an aspect we studied, we found that revitalisation was welcomed due to the recognised problems of urban decline with the majority of interview participants identifying improved outcomes, especially relating to the public realm (e.g. new library, cultural precincts, heritage enhancements). Many also expressed a desire for continued public investment in revitalisation initiatives. Fewer respondents reported on satisfactory opportunities to collaborate. 
Given the unprecedented level of investment made in RCD one important unintended and fruitful consequence emerged: it acted as an incentive for multiple local actors to continue the revitalisation process through locally-based initiatives and networks of collaboration. For example, leaders from the business community responded by creating an organised Committee for Dandenong to define shared principles for development and lobby government for more investment in local infrastructure, while local traders became more active in retail associations or new trader groups were created to support retail activity, particularly in food services.  
c) The social and economic outcomes are mostly on track to meet revitalisation goals (see Section 13). There are some emerging threats, many of which rely on the resourcefulness of local actors to mitigate impacts in society. For example, one major concern is dwindling funding to support the integration of migrants, especially former refugees. Church groups, community services, non-for-profit organisations (e.g. St Vincent de Paul) and local government (e.g. through the library) provide services with little funding or through volunteer arrangement to meet their needs, for example in finding housing and necessary furniture, offering English-language classes and providing legal aid. This is a fragile arrangement as it relies on the capacity of these groups to voluntarily coordinate responses to migrant needs without government support.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At the end of March 2011, the Jena Citizens' Energy Cooperative (BürgerEnergie Jena eG) was created. Supported by the political majority (Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and the Green Party) in the city council, the cooperative acquired a 2% share of the municipal energy company in February 2012 and paved the way for an innovative model of democratic participation in the energy sector. The take over of the shares of the municipal utility was made possible through a change within the shareholder structure of the utility. Originally, the municipal council planed to keep part of the shares originally held by E.On and bought back by Thüga for the new cooperative. However, Thüga insisted in the negotiations on acquiring the totality of E.On's shares, i.e. 20% of the municipal company, and obliged the city to transfer some shares from its own portfolio to the cooperative. 

b) The official aim was to 'promote a decentralised, affordable, environmentally and climate-friendly energy supply based on 100% renewable energy sources '. As a shareholder of the municipal utility, the representatives of the citizen cooperatives could then attempt to influence the local energy policy toward more renewable energy sources and more energy efficiency measures. The cooperative model would enable citizens citizens to exercise control over the policy of the municipal company, and to obtain financial participation.

c) In the start of the period observed, the idea of setting up a cooperative was initiated by three key players in the city's environmental policies (the then head of the finance department and former chairman of the Green Party in the city council; the former director of the municipal energy company; and the current Green deputy mayor for the environment and urban planning). In the context of the 2009 municipal elections, the initiators of the cooperative embarked on an important negotiation process with the different political parties in order to include the project in the political programme. In October 2010, an agreement was voted in the city council, allowing the cooperative to take over up to 10% of the municipal company 

In the second period of observation, the Jena citizens' energy cooperative was officially established. The initiators strated negociations with the members of the city council in order to obtain shares of the municipale utility. After several months of negotiation, the municipal council finally voted in February 2012 to sell 2% of its shares to the cooperative. In parallel to the political negotiations, the members of the cooperative made use of the various local media and  started to organise ""citizen energy meetings"" to discuss energy issues, inform citizens about the cooperative's activities and recruit new members. Finally, all the shares of the cooperative were sold in just over two years. 

In the end of the period observed, while contributing to creation of areas of debate between citizens and experts on local energy policies, the cooperative struggled to meet its objectives of supporting democratially the local energy transition. On the one hand, the possibility of supporting energy transition by investing in local renewable energy projects was hampered by geographical and regulatory factors. On the other side, the members of the cooperative voted with a high majorirty to return all profits to its members rather than investing a part in revewable energy projects. ";5;4;Self-initiated by participants;5;5;Off;4;4;5;4;4;4;Off;Off;4;Reasonably confident;"a)The three key actors of the city with important responsibilities whithtin the city's environmental administration and policies. They had strong link to the citiy council, municipal administration and the municipal utilities, as part or former part of these different bodies. They could also rely on strong relationships with local citizens initiatives focusing on the energy and climate issues. As a relatively small cities, and due to their functions, the central participants of the project had regular interactions. 

b) Within the cooperative, the collaboration was initiated rather informally through the initiators and with the support of several actors engaged in the energy and climate policy issues. Outside the cooperative, the collaboration between the cooperative and the local decision-makers was initiated by the initiators of the cooperative, who bargained with the city council to obtain some shares of the municipal utility. 

c) With just 2% of the municipal company's capital and, since 2016, only one seat on the board of director, the cooperative has formally very little influence in the company. Nevertheless, it can assert its interests, argue to try to convince other actors and win allies in the shareholders' assembly and the board of directors, obtain useful information on the strategy of the municipal enterprise, or propose certain points in the agenda of these two decision-making bodies. In addition, there are also semi-formalised forms of interaction, notably in the context of the citizens' energy meetings (Bürger Energietreff) organised by the cooperative about four times a year. These meetings, which are open to the public, allow participants to discuss different energy issues with energy experts, including employees of the municipal company. The incentives to collaborate is based on the willingness to let citizens take part in the local energy transition, both politically (by letting them having a voice on that matter) and financially (by getting back money from their investment in the local energy grid).   

d) Over time, more and more citizens were interesting in investing in the grid because of the political and financial aspects. Once the cooperative could not accept any new members anymore and since the general assembly of the cooperative voted for the a full redistribution of the profit to its members, the tension between the socio-ecological goals and the financial profits increased and always more actors criticised the limited capacity of the cooperative to contribute to the democractisation of the local energy sector. The cooperative lost some of its political supports.   ";1-mei;1-mei;1-mei;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;4;5;3;5;2;Off;5;Off;Mostly confident;"a) The cooperative is composed of three bodies: the management, the board of directors and the general assembly. The latter is the most important body. It normally meets once a year. The assembly brings together all the members of the cooperative, votes on strategic issues and elects the board of directors every four years, which in turn appoints the management. One person of the management board is appointed at the general assembly and on the board of directors of the municipal energy utility. In addition to that, a great majority of the other board members are members of the cooperative, including the management board of the utilitiy. 

b) Alongside these boards, where cooperative members interact formally with other stakeholders, there are the citizens' energy meetings (Bürger Energietreff). They are usually attended by around 40 people, with the number fluctuating according to the topics discussed (strategy of the municipal company, energy storage, smart grids, mobility, energy transition and heat networks, etc.). 

c) By involving the management of the municipal company, members of the municipal administration or certain employees in these meetings, the members of the cooperative bring the actors of local energy policies directly into contact with the inhabitants of Jena, who can thus discuss the functioning and strategies of the municipal company in an open manner and take note of sometimes unpublished information. In such meetings, local elites debate directly with citizens, to whom they have to justify their actions and decisions. 

d) Although the city council refused to sell more shares of the utility to the cooperative, in 2016, it was decided that the cooperative could have a representative at the supervisory board of the municipal utility, although it still owns 2% of the utility (the minimum to get a sit at the board is 5%).

They both contribute to make the cooperative politically and socially accepted. Once the cooperative was established, the leadership was more decentralised as the central strategic decision is taken during the general assembly. One central principle of the cooperative is ""one person = one vote"". This democractic principle enables therefore people to have the same influence on the decision-making process regardless of the amount of shares. 

b) This very democratic principle had an important influence on the collaborative process. During first general meeting, where a decision had to be taken on the use of the 4.1% interest to be returned to the members of the cooperative, there were intense discussions between those who wanted part of the profits to be systematically invested in the development of renewable energy projects and those who wanted to receive all the profits. This second option had been proposed by the management, including some founding members, in order to stimulate citizen investment in the cooperative and to attract new members. For others, it was necessary to invest directly in renewable energies in order to respect the initial goal of the cooperative. As previously written, the general assembly finally decided by a clear majority (80%) to return all profits to its members. Trapped by the democratic principle of the cooperative's operation, the management had to face numerous criticisms, particularly from the different parties represented in the municipal council. 

c) Switch from a leadership concentrated among few actors in the beginning to a more democratic leadership as the cooperative was established.

Within the cooperative, more informal interactions between the local elites and citizens. Members of the local elites also belong to the cooperative and meet the other citizens during the general assemblies. Citizens' energy meetings happen in various public locations in the cities, which provide a good atmosphere for informal exchanges. 

b) shared outcomes are formally formulated during the board meetings of the utility, in which the cooperative has not a lot of influence. 

c) no real change over time has been observed in this matter. ";4;4;2;Off;2;2;2;Off;1;1;1;Off;4;4;4;1;1;1;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;4;4;4;Off;3;5;5;5;3;4;3;3;3;5;5;5;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"a) the goals of the collaboration were formulated first within the cooperative's mission statement, which aimed to collaborate within the municipal utility in order to contribute to the local energy transition. The input of the cooperative was expected to be brought into the utility formally through the boards. 


b) The collaboration between the cooperative and the municipal utilities is monitored at different levels. First, the behavior and action of the cooperative coud be controlled within the utility via the board of directors and the general assembly of the utility. The cooperative is represented within both boards, where it interacts/deliberates with the other shareholders of the utility, among other the city council. Indirectly the action of the cooperative is also discussed and controlled at the city council, where the local representatives deliberate about the role of the cooperative. As elected representatives, they have to see if the cooperative follows the general interest of the inhabitants and take public stances on it. Second, the cooperative and its role within the utility is accountable to its members, who are part of jena's inhabitants, including stakeholders such as local representatives, employees of the utility and members of the board of directors of the utility. 

c) Because it was found out that the cooperative did invest a lot for the local energy transition and reversed high return on investments to its members, more and more local representatives blocked the growth of the cooperative within the municipal utility by impeding it to get more shares. Some local politicians publicly criticised the cooperative for not working in line with the interest of the city. Despite that, the cooperative did not obtain more shares and at least a sit on t eh board of directors leading to reinforce its weight within the utility's governance.

Even with a seat on the board of the enterprise, the cooperative still does not have a majority. Therefore, it does not really have the power to co-manage the municipal enterprise and can at best try to enrich the debates within these bodies by bringing a new perspective. The financial participation, which is supposed to contribute to a democratisation of the local economy by allowing citizens to become owners of the company, has been widely criticised by various actors who perceive this decision as a form of privatisation to the detriment of the general interest. Finally, the cooperative project has contributed to the strengthening of deliberative participation: it has favoured communication between citizens and the various experts by opening up arenas of debate on local energy policies to citizens (through citizens' meetings outside the cooperative and with general assemblies inside the cooperative). However, it was also in the latter forum that a downward revision of the renewable energy investment ambitions was debated and voted, thus contributing to blocking the development of the project and weakening its potential for economic participation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The central infrastructures were the electric grid and electric supplier (utility). The grid had been privatised and its operator (Vattenfall) had no ambitions for such a transition. In 2014 a window of opportunity opened as the 20 year contract to operate the grid expired and could be terminated by the city senate. Energy prices were regarded as unjust and too high.
Control and ownership by the city senate alone was mistrusted as it had privatised the system before. The Senate and administration were reluctant to follow to popular opinion and enforce a renewable transition. The referendum coalition had to build enough pressure in the city society to enforce a referendum and win it.

b) The aim was to move the senate to terminate the contract and take the grid back into public
ownership, and and create a “social, ecological, and democratic” public electricity utility.
Secondly, the grid should have been a stepping stone to massive public investments in RES to
power it with 100% renewable, regional energy.
Thirdly, social justice and democratic control were not means to create legitimacy but ends in
themselves, as well as mechanisms through which a decentralized and ecological energy transition could be implemented and held accountable. This was an attempt to introduce a new model for how public utilities (grid operator and supplier) could be run - through direct democratic control. Primary frames of organizing included that essential services should be public and not for profit, climate justice, energy democracy, that all should have access to energy and participation in its decision making, and ""socialization""/new models of public ownership and democratic and social control.

c) In the start of the period observed (2010 - 2011) app. 50 grass root initiatives united in one coalition, the BET (Berliner Energietisch). They had to agree on internal rules to discuss, moderate, decide and speak in public. They succeeded. In the middle of the p.o. (2011 - 2013) BET had to mobilise thousands of volunteers to collect signatures twice. This was a success.
BET had to press the incumbent actors (government) for a favourable date of the vote. This failed, especially as the government thought BET's proposal too far-reaching. BET had to convince the popular opinion in the city for its case and did so. It had to mobilise 25% of the electorate to go vote and failed narrowly (24%), even though 82% of those voting supported BET. 
In the end of the p.o. (2014 - 2021) BET retained a diminished role as observer and critical accompanier. The government coopted the project, starting during the 2012-13 referendum period. 
It established a new grid operator (Berlin Energie) that became the agent of change though with lower ambitions. After a change in government and long court cases BE reached one aim of BET in 2021 in grid re-municipalisation.
A second goal, the new renewable city owned utility was realised too but in a much smaller fashion than desired. The radically democratic element (direct vote and worker control of board) and justice element (price policy) where scraped, though small elements of participation were retained in an advisory board. Public opinion turned widely against privatisation and embraced re-municipalisations. However, BET's model of democratic control of public institutions has been used as a model for successful referenda on housing institutions in Berlin. ";4;4;Self-initiated by participants;2;3;Off;4;4;1;1;5;5;Off;Off;2;Mostly confident;"a) Already at the end of 2010, attac Berlin, Bu¨rgerBegehren Klimaschutz and PowerShift came
together to discuss the possibility of the city of Berlin taking over the Berlin power grid.
They shared a history of collaborating in two very similar but smaller projects: the popular vote on
the S-Bahn (local train transport) 2011, and a referendum pto disclose the secret water contracts that resulted in a success, the re-municipalising the water utility (2004 - 2012). The latter (water) was the first success of a referendum that forced the city government to re-municipalise.
Attac had a leadership in the water campaign and carried then on to energy with similar people.
Continuity of people (mostly volunteers) was greater than that of organisations and names.

b) By 3 non profit Berlin based actors or branches: Attac, Bu¨rgerBegehren Klimaschutz and
PowerShift. In a second step by a one weekend long workshop, in a third step by 12 plenary
sessions (10/2011 – 01/2012).

c) Initiators and those that joined later had a common sense of a joint struggle against a
monopolist, parts of the government and parts of the local press (David against Goliath). The
notion was that only joined forces had a chance. There was a clear sense that climate and
energy were public goods worth ""fighting"" for. (that language was used) Many volunteers had stronger ecological than social-justice motivations, but social and leftist initiatives played a mayor role, including Left and Green parties as supporters, helping to spread the word, and collect signatures. There were not financial incentives for participants, and the coalition retained independence from political parties. 

d) The coalition grew from 3 to app. 50 groups in 2 years. It united a centrist-left labour union,
large NGOs and post-communist and radical green groups. It collected donations and had some foundation funding to pay for staff campaign positions. The alliance reduced its activity after the depressing and narrow defeat in the 11/2013 vote. It then functioned as an observer and visible commentator of the government run institutions (BE and the public utility Berliner Stadtwerke) and the grid concession process. It remained in contact with these newly created government institutions and people associated with the coalition have stayed active in the utility's advisory board, and there have been attempts at interventions in these institutions, open dialog, as well as policy steps that would allow the institutions to function more fully and more in line with the coalition's initial vision (although much of the democratic element was lost, some steps towards improved social policies are visible, and clear changes towards renewable and public goals are clear, though delayed and at a smaller scale than hoped. The coalition also attempts to influence a move towards a more socially just energy transition outside of these institutions, although its influence and membership is much diminished from the high point of the referendum vote. 

On a landscape level major events happened: The Fukushima Accident, the 2nd nuclear exit
decision by the national government, the rapid transition to RES, the highly contested discourse
over national energy policy, the emergence of the climate justice movement, climate camps, wide
politicization of energy, climate change emerged as a topic. Neoliberal ideology of privatisation
began its decline, the social question began to re-emerge in Berlin, popular protests against
Vattenfall in Hamburg (new coal power station).";1-mei;20+;1-mei;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;5;Off;5;5;5;3;Off;3;5;4;5;1;Off;3;Off;Mostly confident;"a) The initial one weekend workshop and the following plenary sessions in 2011 were rather flat in
hierarchies. Plenaries and discussion were open to all and each person had one equal vote disconnected from the groups size or role. Obviously some groups and people had more time, experience and knowledge than others, especially attac and the other 2 initiators. 

In Berlin, referenda are a vehicle for binding implementation of a law that can be written and proposed by the people organizing it, and this was the strategy that the coalition took. They wrote a law, in an open plenary process, that included specific mechanisms of direct democratic control for the public utility and grid operator that would be founded. Large decisions were made in the plenary and there was a drafting committee to draft the law into legal language, and a steering committee. 
An agenda for each meeting was made before hand, every one could contribute, and the meetings were facilitated, sometimes strictly on timing. There was an ethic of benevolence and trust. There were working groups for social, ecological, and democratic elements of developing the law. 

b) Many groups of BET opened participation to a wide range of activists. Theoretically everyone could join the plenary sessions, and they were often large with up to 100 people. But knowledge and time, interest, and culture were obviously key. Participation was primarily of politically engaged people, whether in paid or (mostly) unpaid roles. Participation was not very diverse along lines of immigration background/race, but was somewhat more so across class. There was a special emphasis in drafting that law that participation and voting eligibility be based on city residence, not citizenship status, which was a major challenge to existing electoral rules. 

c) very high, open vote in a circle of people in a room, email list with shared minutes, including from steering committee 

d) Paid campaign positions in the middle period, working groups on certain topics in the middle period, a break down to some core activists in BET the late period as the referendum failed.

""Collaboration"" after the failure of the referendum transferred to fora that were determined and controlled by the state. The fora that were available included a parliamentary inquiry commission on Berlin's energy future (including a former speaker of BET as an expert) that laid the groundwork for the energy policy of the next coalition government, an advisory board in the public energy supplier, and the new staff of the grid operator who built partnerships while they were not having a clear role during the long concession process 2012-2021.
The government actively blocked the success and expansion of the public energy supplier they had created directly before the referendum in an attempt to deflate the vote. The government required that it could only sell energy it produced, but then did not give it resources to produce energy. These restrictions stayed in place until the next Berlin government (SPD-Left-Green) changed them in 2017. The grid concessions were completely intransparent and marked by conflict between the governing parties.
The character of collaboration within the Stadtwerk's advisory committee is highly formalized, namely made up proportionally by party representation in the Parliament (rather than civil society members). Instead of directly elected members, there is parliamentary control, and instead of being a governing body, it is advisory. One thing that the new government changed about the council in 2017 was that a maximum of 50% of a party’s representatives could be parliamentarians; others need to be community members. Left and Green parties mostly choose people who have a connection with BET,while other parties concentrate on former and current parliamentarians. There have been small changes to make it more transparent, but the balances of political power on the council prevent much.
                            ";Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;2;Off;5;5;1;Off;5;5;2;Off;5;Off;5;2;Mostly confident;"a) Early phase: very flat hierarchy, mutual respect and some shared experiences and relationships from the water campaign. Middle phase: leading role in public by 2 speakers for the campaign, a steering committee with representatives from prominent organizational members, and a campaign team, including a lead organizer.

b) Those with success in the water campaign enjoyed respect and trust and benefited the process.  Many relationships, new connections and politicization of city residents and newer activists happened through the campaign, who became leadership for future struggles. There was visible leadership and press speakers, but also a feeling of shared decision making and having created a common process. The campaign created the basis for more crossover between social and ecological fights in the city, and also brought together people who ended up taking on new environmental campaigns together, such as that for a coal exit in Berlin. 
One interviewee did express a form of political empowerment through the development of movement's vision for a law and campaigning to try and get it implemented: ""People understood themselves as actors in city politics – not only as protesters, but as people who can force things to happen. People saw that pressure worked… Civil society has become part of lawmaking, and has become its own actor in city politics.""

c) There are a few different windows into the continuation of leadership dynamics in Berlin's energy policy and institutions as it was affected by Energietisch's interventions. Most energy decisions shifted into intransparent, state-centric modes, where the large coalition that had initiated these ideas had little influence except via outside pressure. However, outside pressure and regular meetings did continue, especially on issues of energy poverty and socially-just building retrofit policies. 

The grid concession process was one measure of this, where disagreements between the two coalition partners (SPD and CDU) led to a concession process that didn't have a clear political goal, and to likely increased legal challenges than would have occurred without such lack of clarity. 

There was leadership from the city-state Parliament to have an inquiry commission to gather a plan for Berlin's energy transition and respond to the social initiative, but this wasn't more than a report until the coalition government changed. Additionally, visible leaders of Energietisch were elected as representatives and became leaders for some policy changes (social, democratic and ecological priorities) from within the state. 

On the whole, the government clearly used its full capacity to work against the initiative, and they were successful. The government was initially unable to make a compromise with the Energietisch coalition, but the government’s offer became the basis for what they would institute unilaterally. 

Within the new public utility the Stadtwerke, decisions are made by the governing board which is anchored in its parent company the larger water utility, and here the Senate (executive branch including ministries) was the primary actor, along with business heads. An advisory board was created that was primarily an intervention point for the other branch of government, the Parliament, but also eventually included some civil society representatives, including those with ties to the Energietisch coalition. The Senate doesn't participate in this forum, which is one of many factors that makes it less relevant. There are actors within the advisory council that have pushed for more transparency and democratic procedures, but the balance of voting means that these changes have been small, most are satisfied with a primarily information and advisory role. One shift was made to host public events as this grouping. The Energietisch initiative as a whole has had a clear mark on these policies however, and they are more social, democratic, and public than they would otherwise be.    ";5;5;3;Off;4;5;5;Off;5;5;2;Off;5;5;2;Off;5;5;5;Off;4;5;5;1;2;Off;Off;1;2;5;5;Off;Mostly confident;"a) Low hierarchies, mutual respect as part of a movement. Some suspicion of parties but parties were allowed to be supporters of the coalition but not organizational members - they were a major force for publicity and signature collection. There was also a campaign team leading signature collection and getting out the vote. 

b) one weekend workshop and later plenary sessions and regular meetings to formulate the campaign demands and vision, as well as co-develop and produce a draft law to put to referendum. Some independent decisions by the campaign team, but direction set by the plenary meetings.

c) Energietisch coalition: started small, took up speed after few months, was highly dynamic in 2013, then largely broke down/lost its relevance, though a core remained and attempted to keep intervening for a social-ecological energy transition 

From the government side, the government was able to selectively adopt movement demands.
The government could accept the demands of renewable and public – especially if these were limited in scale. However, democratic and social demands were fought, rejected, and ignored.

The establishment of BSW with an advisory council are nods to the democratic principles of the referendum law, but ones that have key changes that make them only remnants of what the Energietisch had in mind. Additionally, Energietisch’s social visions, with social tariffs or a free basic amount of electricity, went “too far” into disrupting the commodity and market logic of energy, and it was feared they could run into EU liberalization law, especially if only practiced by one utility. 

It is clear to say that the Energietisch campaign changed the discourse around energy in Berlin and forced the government to act in ways it would not have otherwise.  It is also clear that those with political power did not understand its demands – they did not make sense to them. Most activity, both to do with the grids and the utility, shifted to the terrain of the state where government actors could exercise control, with relatively little opportunity for Energietisch to influence ongoing policy, except through outside pressure, which however waned over time.

a) Goals were set in plenary sessions and jointly with the steering committee and campaign team, monitoring happened by collecting 20.000 and later 228.000 signatures by volunteers
successfully, the final monitoring was the voter turnout of 24% (82% of those in favor). There was also one commissioned campaign survey, and a full campaign team for interaction with volunteers, press, advertising and campaign literature, etc. 

b) Paid positions, speakers and delegates were elected in the main plenary sessions by
everyone present. Votes were taken by all present at meetings. 
There was also a mandated legal proof of the referendum law by the a constitutional court. There was an attempt of politicians to offer the campaign a deal for a diminished law, but the campaign did not accept it. There were also innumerable conversations with people on the street as signatures were collected, and the signature amounts are mandated in referendum law. 
By the standards of the then-existing referendum law in Berlin, the government should have set the date of the election on an existing election date, which would have made the quorum issue moot, but it was a political play to change the date to a special election. The coalition did not have sufficient mobilization to force them to change the date back.  

c) Over the course of the campaign: a certain formalisation took place in the main phase as more decisions needed to be made than activists could understand in the time given, thus trust in delegates had to complement full comprehension.

Once you look at the institutions of the public utility, grid operator, concession process, and energy policy more broadly, there was also a dramatic formalisation, including project management for developing new renewable energy systems (primarily wind and tenant subscribed solar (Mieterstrom)), and the involvement of Parliamentary committees and decisions, ministries, etc. There were attempts throughout to hold the governmental process to the vision of the Energietisch for which 600,000 Berliners voted with public pressure, but with mixed results. The advisory board is an institution of cross governmental monitoring to some extent, along with the direct governmental monitoring through the utility's governing board.

A new model for democratic control of public institutions that's been taken up in subsequent referenda around housing policy in Berlin, and as a model or inspiration for other cities, such as Barcelona, as well as bringing together various movement organizations in Berlin. A furthering of the trend for increased use of referenda in Berlin politics by grassroots actors. 
Multiple policy shifts: with the new 2017 Berlin government, a firm commitment to remunicipalization of the grids and a strong public utility to build out local renewables. 

Although the public utility was created with such political strong limits as to make it virtually non-functional, with the subsequent government (2017) it's become an increasingly important actor in the Berlin energy market, acting as an energy supplier, a renewable project developer, and a contractor for energy retrofits, especially for public buildings. It is one of the main implementers for many aspects of Berlin’s climate plans, and they have cooperation agreements with many Berlin neighborhoods (Bezirke). At the end of 2020, the Stadtwerke had more than 50 MW of installed wind capacity, more than 15 MW of installed solar capacity (more than 200 installed projects) and 15 additional MW of wind coming online soon. Their solar numbers include about half leasing projects with public actors and half tenant energy models – they have 22% of all installed German tenant energy. Also as of late 2020, they supplied 21,500 customers, but had enough energy to cover 56,000 households.

The public utility has some social commitments like not performing shut offs, requiring credit checks to be a subscriber, and investing in communities where it builds renewable projects, and has lower prices than the default provider. The government has reinstated and funded energy debt counseling. These changes are only a remnant, however, of Energietisch's original commoning vision. The campaign's goals of direct democratic control in particular are not present in current energy institutions - participants agree that they would have needed to win the referendum to do so. 

b) Probably a strong support for the subsequent evolution of the climate justice movement, for
further attempts to de-privatise, a certain disenchantment with social democracy and the
electorate but that is very hard to assess. The above-mentioned impacts of subsequent referenda, grassroots policy ideas around models of democratic control. 

The campaign's ideas clearly shaped the development of Berlin's energy policy, though the government at the time re-interpreted as they saw fit. The subsequent government has instituted more of the campaign's vision especially in terms of renewable energy development, but the scale remains relatively small, and the character of the institutions have only remnants of original visions. A clear de-legitimization of the electric provider Vattenfall. 

c) The electricity grid was de-privatised in 2021 with little public attention when Vattenfall offered to sell it to the city; the re-municipalisation of the gas grid finally failed in 2021 (although the concession renews again in 2024 and Berlin has already said it want to take it over then). Berlin Energie as an actor seems relatively more open to social and democratic goals than the Stadtwerke but how they will develop as they take on a real role is unclear. 

With the help of some of the elected representatives that came out of the Energietisch campaign, referendum law in Berlin has been changed to make it harder for future governments to thwart referendum coalitions - referenda must now take place on existing election days, and there are limits to how long the government can take to examine a referendum's legality.

Since 2005, GACF invested their resources in areas where they could have the most impact. In short, they consulted first with forestry officials and researchers at the regional level to identify local villages that they could work with, especially those that are the poorest. Rural China and its local government at the township and county level exhibit different governance patterns, local ecology, influence from provincial government’s financial capacity, and social dynamics, and thus is difficult to generalize. However, the government structure remained similar across regions and the necessary information flow among different levels within the government represent a common challenge to policy implementation. Most importantly, county governments have become the center of resource allocation and policy implementation since early 2010s and township government became less important in the collective decision-making process among local officials and the communist party cadres. Village level decision-making largely relies on village council, which constitute of three to a dozen people depending on the population size of the village..GACF focused on reforestation as their highest priority in western rural Shanxi province in this reforestation partnership between the Shilou county government, the county forestry bureau, and Si village. This cross-sector collaboration was formed since the beginning and remained the key stakeholders throughout the observation period by this author from 2009 to 2019. All four stakeholders remained important decision-makers due to the present of strong collaborative leadership. The goals were to find an appropriate way to reforest on the challenging Loess Plateau landscape that is effective in terms of acceptable tree survival rate and growth. Before the initiation of this partnership in 2005, the central government of China designed the Returning Farmland to Forest policy in 1999 in response to the flooding events occurred in the lower reach of the Yellow and Yangtze River. Shanxi province is located at the middle reach of the Yellow river and on the eastern part of the Loess Plateau, which make reforestation a relatively important policy among others. On the other hand, Shanxi province is the second largest coal producing province, second only to Inner Mongolia, and thus reforestation is politically significant in terms of its role in reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. 
The implementation of the Returning Farmland to Forest policy provided an important financial incentive and resources and legitimacy for reforestation for the local governments in rural areas. However, the implementation process was poorly designed and became a source of conflict in some rural communities. The performance on the part of local government created barriers for building trust between local villagers and therefore influence the process of the reforestation partnership between GACF and local villagers. The other reason GACF also had difficulty building trust with local villagers was because of previous failed working relationships with villagers and officials in other reforestation projects in Guangdong and Shanxi province. In sum, local institutions in terms of policy implementation and social dynamics between officials and villagers played an important role in resolving conflicts and the success of reforestation.  ..

Individuals from GACF started their poverty alleviation work through professional networks and connections. These individuals from GACF, Shilou county government and forestry bureau, Si village council had no prior working relations before this reforestation partnership. However, GACF has on-going reforestation and poverty alleviation projects in Guangdong province and two other villages in Shanxi province. These working experiences heavily affected the operating dynamics and trust building. Navigating rural China also require political skills and knowledge that comes through local facilitators such as local officials or community members. Reforestation in Shanxi province and on the Loess Plateau are challenging due to both logistics, lack of resources, and ecological reasons. The ex-vice deputy of the Shanxi provincial forestry academy introduced GACF to the Wang Village in rural area and started their partnerships in 2004. However, Wang Village’s reforestation project eventually was terminated by GACF due to a lack of performance and trust building with local communities. The ex-vice deputy then introduced GACF to Si village in Shilou county. Shilou county government officials were responsive and proactive to engage with GACF and appeared to have strong incentives to collaborative due to their lack of access to resources and being remote from urban areas. The Returning Farmland to Forest policy and on-going poverty alleviation efforts by both the central and provincial government also provided strong incentives and legitimacy for reforestation. In short, the lack of alternative development resources such as coal compared to neighboring counties provided the core incentives to collaborate. The condition demonstrated a strong awareness of interdependence. 
.The collaboration started with a strong focus on the technical aspect of reforestation, which opened up a space for more collaboration as stakeholders in Shilou county took action to resolve problems and shared the responsibility of implementation and monitoring. GACF gradually increased their financial commitment to the partnership and sought researchers and scientists to evaluate their reforestation effectiveness in 2013. Local villagers’ wiliness to participate in the project was based on benefits in the form of rent and labor. Participating villagers wanted to opt out of the collaboration a few times due to the changing socio-economic environment and their perceived benefits and costs by continued participation. These conflicts were mediated by local legitimate leaders at both the county and village level.

The ground rules of the collaboration in the form of local knowledge are difficult to translate clearly to GACF due to both cultural and language barriers. GACF are formed by people in Hong Kong who operated under different legal and financial system than mainland China. Therefore, there was no institutionalized ground rules and the partnership relied on leadership skills and ad hoc arrangements. Due to the solid leadership skills and a supportive county government, the decision-making process was relatively transparent compared to other rural reforestation projects that GACF has invested in. The highly engaged local officials and village council significantly improved the overall decision-making process. Nevertheless, the information flow and communication were mostly limited to key leaders in the village council, the county forestry bureau and GACF. There was no institutionalized documentation of meetings except for land rental agreements with villagers and reforestation contracts with the forestry bureau. ..Participating villagers were recruited by village council and volunteers. In total, 26 out of 60 households in Si village gradually joined the partnership through land rental agreements. Villagers also participated in the capacity of monitoring and protecting the trees from fire hazard, grazing, and other human-induced damages. These collective efforts were organized by village council. The Shilou county forestry bureau was responsible for tree-planting labor and providing seedlings. In this partnership, the forestry bureau also took extra effort to monitor the tree planting outcome as compared to normal policy implementation process under the mandate of Returning Farmland to Forest policy. The local dynamic within Si village and between Si village and the county government appeared relatively cooperative. The Shilou county government was willing to share capacity and credit with the village council and leaders, an important factor in sustaining the partnership overtime. The key stakeholders and leaders remained the same overtime and the institutional structure as well. Nevertheless, the partnerships gradually grew to include county water resource and education bureau through both informal and formal arrangements with the goal of improving rural development. ;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;5;Off;5;5;5;Off;5;5;5;Off;5;Off;5;5;Highly confident;"The collective leadership grew throughout the collaboration and worked in triadic form. The village leader, the forestry officer, and the GACF executive were responsible for major decision-making. They acted as the problem solver and communicated the needs and concerns from each group and institutional constituents. The county level government official provided administrative and political support for the reforestation partnership and helped build trust with the leaders in GACF. Leadership skills were crucial for building trust among villagers. The village leader was a community member who had credibility with both the government and the village. The village leader convinced and recruited villagers to participate in the partnership since the initiation of the reforestation project and used his personal network to acquire tree planting materials for the partnership, which greatly lower the cost. The forestry officer was a trust-worthy official within the county government as demonstrated by his ability to liaise across government bureaus and established strong working relations with GACF executive. 

The reforestation partnership meet face to face twice a year and relied on phone or email for communication. This lack of face-to-face time appeared to place constraints on village leader’s ability to fully communicate local concerns and thus put pressure on his leadership and as a result put pressure on local government’s legitimacy. GACF relied heavily on the village leader and the forestry officer to coordinate local affairs and lack an understanding of how local institution works. This gap in local knowledge on the part of GACF created challenge for resolving local conflicts. Nevertheless, the leadership skills and a cooperative local dynamic between villagers and the local officials in Shilou county appeared to provide effective conflict resolution. Finally, Shilou county lack access to resources that could only be provided through a partnership through GACF, such as learning opportunities about advance forestry science, prestige, and connections through GACF’s network. The local officials especially perceived the partnership as an opportunity to improve their reforestation efforts and participate in modern development approaches such as those brought about by GACF.

The interaction between local villagers and GACF was less clear due to lack of data collection and lack of a structured deliberation process from the beginning. Face-to-face meetings were limited to twice a year and GACF often used the time to do outreach for fund-raising purpose rather than setting formal ground rules or understanding local concerns. The somewhat top-down approach of GACF was sustained because of effective leadership skills by the village leader and the forestry officer. The GACF operated under the assumption that a nature-based reforestation program would not need investment in management and monitoring. However, the local institutions and the inconsistent policy implementation history in rural China meant that active management on the part of local communities is crucial. This understanding was communicated first in 2013 by the village leader but due to a lack of trust in local management capacity, GACF did not respond directly. In 2017, the village leader lobbied GACF to directly invest in monitoring through hiring local villagers as a way to increase local ownership, participation by and benefits for villagers. 

The long-term goal of this partnership is to improve rural development and poverty alleviation. Through reforestation, GACF aim to restore local ecosystem function and support agriculture development. GACF’s reforestation approach had proven to be effective in terms of high tree survival rate and change in local micro-climate. These visible outcomes were critical for sustaining collaboration. GACF continued to invest in the partnership while local officials sought to increase the impact of the collaboration through side supportive infrastructure projects such as building water storage facility and irrigation system for farming. As the forest continued to mature and formed canopy, the successful reforestation served as a shared asset among local government, owned by local village, and managed by both local government and the village.

The collaboration was highly and narrowly focused on reforestation targets. The procedures, protocols, agreements focused on reforestation and GACF invested resources and energy into reforestation goal attainment. There was no investment in direct livelihood planning except for institutionalized a scholarship for local students in 2019. ..As stated in the previous section, GACF did not expect to put effort into monitoring and was ignorant of how the responsibility of monitoring and management was on village council rather than the local government. The Returning Farmland to Forest policy was still the main reforestation programs in Shanxi province and how local residents understand reforestation. In this context, there is inconsistency in monitoring and what successful and sustained reforestation meant. According to the county forestry bureau, local reforestation survival rate ranged from 20 to 80% and about 50% of the reforestation on bare land failed. ..Due to the strong incentive to collaborate and achieve reforestation goals on the part of Shilou county government, local officials invested in staff and resource to monitoring. The village leader’s proactive participation in the partnership was evidenced by his effort in conflict resolution, communicating local concerns during face-to-face meetings, acting as a local host, and lobbying skills. The villagers had been vocal about their view on the opportunity cost of participating in the partnership since 2008 when the crop price fluctuated and when rent increased. The villagers’ active participation in this sense was ignored by GACF. Therefore, accountability was achieved in an uneven way. GACF demanded accountability from local government and villagers, but the demand was based on insufficient understanding of local institutions. This situation was slightly improved towards the later period of the partnership when reforestation success had already been demonstrated and when GACF had more space to accommodate to other needs demanded by local villagers.

The Shilou county government successfully built trust with villagers and GACF to gradually gained legitimacy for the partnership. The local officials were aware of the challenge and economic cost involved in reforestation on the Loess Plateau and recognized the benefits and opportunity to collaborate with a non-profit organization. The local government are also aware of the complexity of reforestation in terms of local village dynamics and the uncertainties that embedded within the larger socio-economic environment. The formation and initiation of the partnership was marked by a structured support by the local government and an intentional selection of participating village. Local officials anticipated this challenge and understood the key roles played by leaders. This mentality of sharing capacity sustained the collaboration..
The unintended consequences included the expansion of the collaboration to livelihood, education and agriculture sectors. Social capital increased because of active participation of the collective leadership. The local leaders in Shilou county demonstrated reforestation success to GACF and earned trust through problem-solving, active communication, and conflict mediation. The commitment increased the villagers’ willingness to participate, and help showed the value of such partnership when other types of socio-economic outcome was not achieved immediately. In 2016, local villagers lobbied to build a 20 meters long bridge. In 2018, the village leader lobbied both the government and GACF to build a park for the local community. 

After the success of reforestation, the stakeholders shifted their focus towards management. This is the process that created most conflict due to lack of knowledge and a structured deliberation process to communicate how local institutions works. The resources needed to implement monitoring and management were not taken into consideration by GACF and despite the active communication on the part of the village leader, this barrier was not resolved until 2017. This reflected a need for a more structured deliberation process. ..The reforested landscape had demonstrated a different kind of reforestation outcome than the ones produced under the Returning Farmland to Forest policy. The collaboration built a strong partnership between the county government, the village, and the non-profit organization. GACF increased their intended reforestation output to become a long-term partner for the county government. It is unclear how local villagers perceive future collaboration that could generate lasting impacts because many of the poverty alleviation efforts are embedded in systematic challenges such as infrastructure and insufficient resources.

The Committee is a permanent statutory committee of the lower house and it is primarily concerned with issues of public accountability. From time to time, the Committee is also asked by the Parliament or by a Minister to examine a particular policy issue, as was the case for the Energy Inquiry.

In late 2011 the NSW Minster for Resources and Energy requested an Inquiry into the comparable economics of energy generation in New South Wales (hereafter ‘the Inquiry""). As part of its Inquiry the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) commissioned an independent research foundation  – newDemocracy – to design and convene an innovative citizen engagement process. This community engagement process was to supplement the standard parliamentary inquiry procedure in which the Committee: 1) calls for public input and invites submissions from individuals and organisations; 2) reviews this ‘evidence’; and 3) prepares a report which is then tabled in Parliament. The Government then considers the report, and is required to formally respond (typically within three months). 

So in parallel to the conventional parliamentary inquiry process, PAC commissioned  two concurrent citizens’ juries: one run in a metropolitan area (Sydney); and the another in a regional centre (Tamworth). 

The citizens' juries provided the elected representatives in the parliamentary with an opportunity to hear from a sector of the community that it struggles to reach, and thus represent. More specifically, it heard the considered views of a cross section of citizens from metropolitan and regional NSW on energy issues. 

The focus in this case study is on the informal collaborations between the MPs in the PAC and the citizens in the citizens' juries (see question 21 for more). 

According to Committee members (who were interviewed by the author) all the recommendations emerging from both citizens’ juries were fully considered, and discussed at length. A number of members commented that they particularly valued the quality of the citizens’ inputs. Most of the MPs stated that the citizens’ juries added specific value to their final report, one that could not be captured in existing submissions. These positive self-reports hold some truth when one compares the citizens’ recommendations with the committee’s final report to parliament. However, the content analysis also reveals that the Committee misinterpreted or watered down some of the more controversial suggestions or issues of concern to the citizens.



";1;5;Externally directed by law or authority;1;3;Off;4;4;5;5;1;1;Off;Off;3;Highly confident;"This case is about informal collaborations between elected representatives in the PAC and everyday randomly selected citizens (who participate in one of the two citizens' juries). 

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the NSW Parliament is concerned with issues of public accountability.  In terms of membership, the PAC is composed of elected representatives, drawn from political parties in similar proportions to that in the lower house of Parliament (the Legislative Assembly). During the 2012 sitting year, the PAC committee was composed of six MPs: three Liberal party members, one National party member, one member of the Australian Labor Party (‘the opposition’), and one independent member. 

 In terms of public engagement, the PAC typically calls for written public submissions, and in some cases conducts public hearings where select groups or individuals are invited to present to the committee. As part of the Energy Inquiry the committee undertook a number of consultations including:
• Convened two public hearings (with invited witnesses and the public able to view the deliberations in the gallery), transcripts publicly available
• Called for submissions via a newspaper advertisement (received 39 submissions), submissions publicly available
• Three site visits (coal power station, gas fired power station and a wind farm). 

In addition to these conventional consultative processes, the committee Chair (MP Mr. Jonathan O’Dea) was interested in experimenting for the first time with citizens' juries to explore broader community views on energy issues. With the support of the committee, the Chair commissioned the newDemocracy foundation – an independent non-partisan research foundation interested in democratic innovation – to design two citizens' juries into the Energy Inquiry. The resulting participatory design involved two concurrent citizens’ juries: one run in an urban centre (Sydney); and the another in a rural centre (Tamworth).

There was no formal collaborative interactions between the citizens and the MPs in their respective deliberative spaces. Instead the outputs from one site – the citizens' juries – were fed into the deliberations of the legislative committee (PAC). Notwithstanding this institutional separation, some informal mixing and collaboration between the MPs and the citizens emerged in two noteworthy instances:

1)  at one of the citizens' juries (Tamworth) most of the Committee members attended and directly observed the citizens' deliberations. During this process the MPs had the opportunity to interact face-to-face with the citizens, and listen to their arguments, questions and concerns.
2) at an informal luncheon at the parliament where approximately fifteen of the citizens (who had participated in the juries) presented their recommendations to the PAC 

In terms of prior knowledge, the MPs in PAC had no prior knowledge or association with the randomly selected citizens in the two juries. They also had very low degree of interdependence.

 ";20+;20+;20+;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;5;5;Off;5;5;5;5;Off;4;4;4;4;4;Off;3;Off;Highly confident;"Both the citizens' juries and the PAC have very strong procedural rules about participation, and rules of conduct and decision making. 

The citizens’ remit, which was determined by the Committee in consultation with newDemocracy, was to consider the financial and public perception aspects of alternative forms of electricity generation – one of several themes under consideration in the broader Energy Inquiry. In return the Committee formally stated: “that the Jury’s recommendations will be provided to the NSW government as part of the Committee’s final report” (PAC 2012 p. 193).

However, the interactions and collaborations between the MPs and citizens was much less clear. 

The citizens were brought into the Committee’s inquiry process, rather than the committee responding to a citizen-driven agenda. In other words, the MPs were able to mutually adjust their preferences in light of the citizens’ recommendations but the reverse was not possible since the citizens’ deliberated in isolation from, and prior to the committee’s deliberations. In this sense the opportunities for mutual adjustment were limited from the beginning. 

Second, the Committee was keen to keep their Inquiry at arms length from the citizens' juries in order to protect the independence and integrity of the citizens’ deliberations. At the same time they did not want to give the impression of disinterest or neglected; the citizens needed reassurance that the Committee would take their recommendations seriously. Here newDemocracy (as the convenor) served as a useful mediating institution that was able to create some distance between the MPs in the committee and the citizens in the citizens' juries. 

While the PAC publicly celebrated the citizens' juries and published the citizens' reports in their final report to parliament, it was not transparent how and why the MPs adopted some of the citizens recommendations but not others.

For example, some of the citizens’ policy suggestions were accepted by the PAC. The most significant substantive contribution of the citizens' juries was described by the Chair as follows (PAC 2012, vii.): 
Demand Management was a major theme of feedback received from the innovative Citizens’ Policy Jury, which informed the Committee’s deliberations. Demand Management became a key focus of this Inquiry, with ten of the reports 24 recommendations addressing this issue (p. vii).

But a number of the more controversial suggestions or issues of concern to the citizens were watered down or completely ignored. Some of politically sensitive proposals (such as nuclear energy) were noted by the Committee but not endorsed. 

The informal collaborations between MPs and citizens all took place before the MPs tabled their report to Parliament. This meant that citizens were not given the opportunity to directly question committee members about party positions, and explore why some of the citizens juries recommendations were not taken up. 

";Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;5;5;3;Off;5;4;3;Off;5;5;3;Off;5;Off;4;2;Highly confident;"Central to this case is the leadership of the Committee Chair, Jonathan O'Dea MP who seeded the idea of embedding a citizens' jury within the parliamentary inquiry.  He persistently championed the jury model and the value of listening to the informed views of citizens on complex policy issues. For example, he encouraged his fellow committee members to learn about citizens' juries, to observe them, and he created new informal spaces where citizens and MPs could meet and mix. 

The Committee Chair also functioned as an “enabling leader” who reached out to an independent organization (newDemocracy) to design and convene the juries.  Interestingly one MP suggested that the relationship at times between the Chair and newDemocracy may have been too close, where the Chair maybe have become too much of a ‘process champion’, but it was also acknowledged that it is a tricky balancing act. 

The Committee Chair also used the citizens' juries as an opportunity to promote his capacity to be an innovative leader. For example, he took many opportunities to publicise the process both within parliament and in the media. When visiting the citizens at their regional deliberations, most of the Chair’s time was consumed with public relations activities (including several pre-recorded radio interviews and several press meetings with print and television teams) rather than interacting with the citizens. This public relations effort could be viewed as a distraction from the consultative intentions of the citizens' juries. On the other hand the Chair’s efforts to widely publicise the citizens' juries and its findings can also be viewed as evidence of effective collaborative leadership and entrepreneurship.";1;1;1;Off;3;3;3;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;3;Off;3;1;3;1;3;Off;Off;1;3;1;3;Off;Reasonably confident;See extensive discussion under Question 21. ;4;4;2;Off;2;2;1;Off;3;2;2;Off;4;4;4;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;4;4;3;Off;1;4;4;4;1;Off;1;Off;1;1;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"
The PAC formally reported to the NSW Parliament on the outcomes of their inquiry, making  24 recommendations. In this report the MPs referred to the citizens' juries, and responded to the citizens' recommendations. The NSW Minister then gave a formal response to  Parliament on the  PAC's Report.  

While relevant government agencies and interest groups were involved in various aspects of the Inquiry they had little or no involvement with the citizens in the two citizens' juries. 

The media covered the citizens' juries - largely due to the public relations efforts of the Chair (see response to Q. 37). There was however little or no public media coverage on whether, how and to what extent the government acted on citizen recommendations.  

Indirectly the informal collaborations between MPs and citizens in this case served to create an 'informal’ accountability between elites and the public. As one MP explained, he was keen for the committee’s report to reflect a message of gratitude to the citizens (MP3, 15 Nov 2015): 
I wanted to basically say to these people, yeah, we heard what you said and we thank you for the time you gave, you didn’t have to do it, you didn’t have to give up your weekends but you were part of this process and we acknowledge it by making sure you know we heard you…. I wouldn’t normally have that attitude to public submissions.  

The public elements of the Committee process also facilitated some of the moralizing effects that publicity can create for policy deliberations, such as encouraging public rather than private reasons. For example, when the Committee tabled their final report, five of the six members (including those most sceptical of the juries) stood up in Parliament and congratulated the citizens for their contributions to the report. In other words, in the public arena all the MPs were keen to be seen to be supporting the citizens and their policy efforts in this instance.

This is mostly because the timing of the Inquiry was out of step wit a host of other policy discussions and decisions that were taking place at the state and federal level. Energy policy is particularly multifaceted and fast moving policy domain, and in a federal system,  initiatives or recommendations on energy and climate change policy at the state level can be quickly superseded by national initiatives. 

While the direct policy impacts in this case may have been limited, the collaborations between the MPs and the citizens from the citizens' juries demonstrated to elected representatives in Australia that our parliamentary institutions can adapt and incorporate more innovative forms of public engagement. 

The collaborations also appear to have shifted the way some of the MPs view and engage with the broader public. As one MP explained : 
""What community members tend to write to you is about is price impacts or the immediate concern they have of affordability or capacity to pay.  But when you deal with these forums, they’re actually considering the whole issue and the broader context ...  So there’s a much more considered position and they have the time and they’re bouncing off others and listening to experts.  It’s a more considered view than perhaps a reaction to something when you’re writing to your local member about one aspect of the particular problem…"" For some MPs the main value of citizens' juries was in their capacity to ‘test’ public opinion on a policy, or on a controversial local issue. 

Most PAC members in this case felt that MPs could engage more constructively with citizens in their parliamentary work. As one MP explained (MP4, 15 Nov 2012): 
Parliament consults, likes to consult, so consultation is not a new thing, but the notion of consulting a random group of people through a deliberative process is something that we don’t do....in a citizens' jury process it’s about educating them to come up with an informed view, not just a snapshot, or superficial response, and that is very important.  Where this sort of process, I think, works, is where there is a relatively complex challenge or question or .... terms of reference.

Outlaw motorcycle gang (OMG) 'No Surrender' and its members allegedly played a key role in these crimes (Idem, pp.223-227). Its clubhouse was located in a village in Noord-Brabant (Idem, p.227). The main goal of the mayor of this village became to close the clubhouse to stop the illegal practices and to restore the public order in the local community (Idem, pp.230-232).

Before the collaboration started, there had not been any significant regional coordination on the societal challenge as presented above. The original case description shows that there were several problems to overcome:

1. Municipalities did not consider crime fighting as one of their main goals; this was seen as something that was in the hands of the law enforcement authorities (Idem, p.217). Therefore, it took some time before the particular local government started to play a role in crime fighting. Another problem that the collaborative partners faced was that each municipality had its own public order policy, which meant that it was difficult to align approaches (Idem, p.217). Besides, it turned out that municipalities were not so willing to share information with others (Idem, p.217). All these issues hampered regional coordination.

2. Just as the local governments, the public prosecution service faced some challenges in information sharing. Besides, the organization had a lack of capacity, which meant that it could not live up to the expectations of other crimefighting organizations in the field (Idem, pp.218-219). 

3. A major challenge for the police was the reorganization that started in 2012. As a result, the organization focused on its internal processes and paid less attention to collaboration with external partners (Idem, p.221). This, of course, was a challenge for setting up the regional coordination on drugs related crimes.

4. In the tripartite consultation – a frequent meeting between the mayor, the district chief of the police and the district chief of the public prosecution service – the representatives of the three organizations admitted that their work was fragmented and divided (Idem, p.217). These partners acknowledged that they had to work towards a more collective approach.

(b) The ambition of the regional (i.e., RIEC and task force) and local (i.e., municipality in which the clubhouse of No Surrender was located) initiatives was to reduce the number of illegal practices and drugs related crimes in Noord-Brabant (Idem, pp.221-223). For the local coordination, there was the desired outcome of the closing of the No Surrender clubhouse (Idem, pp.230-232). 

(c) First, there was a broader orientation on drugs related crime fighting in Noord-Brabant (Idem, pp.221-223), while later there was a specific focus on closing a clubhouse of an OMG of which its members were closely related to these illegal practices (Idem, pp.230-232). However, the challenge and ambition was and still is reducing the number of drugs related crimes in Noord-Brabant. With the passing of time, the partners involved became more used to the new collaborative approach and were both more able and willing to share information (Idem, pp.221-223).

Regional: From the case description, it does not become clear whether partners involved in the Regional Information and Expertise Center (RIEC) and the task force ‘Organized crime’ knew each other beforehand or not. However, in 2005 already a regional pilot on ‘Cannabis and organized crime’ had started, because of concerns about the increasing number of drugs related crimes in Noord-Brabant (Cels et al., 2017, p.218). It is likely that partners involved in the RIEC or task force may have worked together in this pilot, but again, we do not know this for certain.

Local: The mayor, district chief of the police and district chief of the public prosecution service knew each other from the tripartite consultations (Idem, pp.215-216). According to the Dutch Police Law (2012, art.13), the police is under dual authority: for the maintenance of public order and for the provision of assistance, the authority lies with the mayor and for law enforcement, the authority lies with the public prosecutor. 

(b) 
Regional: In 2008, the Ministry of Justice started the National and Regional Information and Expertise Centers (LIEC and RIEC), which were initiated to support local governments in sharing information about illegal practices and criminal networks. Thereafter, the Ministry of Security and Justice started the task force ‘Organized crime’ in 2010. This task force was initiated after an appeal by five mayors of the biggest cities in Noord-Brabant for more capacity to fight the illegal cannabis business (Cels et al., 2017, pp.216-217).

Local: In 2013, the mayor of the municipality in which the OMG clubhouse was located put this issue on the agenda of the tripartite consultation. In doing so, the collaboration between the local government, the police and the public prosecution service on this issue was started (Idem, pp.230-232).

(c) 
Both at a regional and local level the societal challenge (i.e., drugs related crimes) was recognized. Besides, on the two levels the various partners involved felt the need to collaborate with others for they lacked the ability and capacity to effectively fight organized crime themselves (Idem, pp.220-221; see also question 13a, organizational issues). As a result, they felt a sense of interdependence and thus an incentive to collaborate.

(d) 
1. The crime fighting partners were first mainly operating at a regional level, but this changed after the mayor of the municipality in which the clubhouse was located started to gain support for the closing of the clubhouse; then local action followed (compare Idem, pp.221-223; pp.230-232).
2. The sharing of information increased at both levels (Idem, pp.221-223; Idem, pp.230-232).
3. The capacity of the police was strengthened, which was expected to have a positive effect on the collaborative crime fighting. However, at the same time, the organization was confronted with a drastic reorganization which reduced this expected effect dramatically (Idem, p.221).

However, what we found is that partners collectively aimed for a better sharing of information about illegal practices and criminal networks within Noord-Brabant. This was done in order to get a better overview of the networks, which enabled them to improve the investigation and prosecution of drugs criminals (Cels et al., 2017, pp.221-222). 

(b) Little information is given on the inclusiveness of the collaborative forum(s). However, it seems that partners that can provide relevant information or capacity are involved in the RIEC (i.e., local governments, (military) police, public prosecution service, tax department, customs, anti-fraud agency, social security intelligence and investigation service, and inspectorate of social affairs and employment) (Cels, De Jong & Groenleer, 2015, p.19), the task force (i.e., (military) police, criminal investigation department, public prosecution service and tax department) (Cels et al., 2017, p.217) and the tripartite consultation (i.e., mayor, district chief of the police and district chief of the public prosecution service) (Idem, pp.230-232). 

(c) The original case description (Idem) gave no insights into the decision-making process within the collaboration.

(d) Based on the original case description (Idem), we cannot determine whether there were significant changes in the institutional architecture of collaboration over time.

(b) Again, the information provided in the original case description (Cels et al., 2017) about the dynamics and impact of leadership on the collaborative process is limited. For the RIEC and the task force, it seems that their project leaders/managers kept an eye on the formulation and realization of the shared goals (Cels et al., 2015, p.13). Furthermore, in the tripartite consultations the mayor took the lead and made a (difficult) decision in case this was needed (Idem, p.2).

(b) Regional: For both the RIEC and the task force the stated ambitions and shared outcomes were formulated in regular meetings and documented in policy reports (Cels et al., 2015, pp.18-19). An integrated approach against drugs related crimes was designed and developed (Cels et al., 2017, p.217), and joint actions (in Dutch: klapdagen) were undertaken (Idem, p.222). Furthermore, quick scans and in-depth analyses of illegal practices and criminal networks were realized (Idem, p.222).

Local: In the tripartite consultation, the stated ambitions and shared outcomes were formulated in the frequent meetings of the mayor, the district chief of the police and the district chief of the public prosecution service. Again, an integrated approach between the collaborative partners was designed and developed, and together they considered opportunities to close the motorcycle clubhouse and to take on the leaders of outlaw motorcycle club No Surrender (Idem, pp.230-232).   

(c) A first major change in the interaction between the actors was that there was an increased willingness to share information with each other at both a regional and a local level (Idem, pp.221-223; Idem, pp.230-232). A second major change in the interaction between the actors was that, firsts, ideas were more abstract (i.e., designing and developing an integrated approach), while later these ideas became more concrete (i.e., quick wins, such as the closing of the clubhouse) later on.

Local: The goals of the tripartite consultations were documented in the reporting of the frequent meetings of the mayor, the district chief of the police and the district chief of the public prosecution service. Their goals were (1) closing the OMG clubhouse (Cels et al., 2017, pp.230-232), and (2) taking on the leaders of the motorcycle club (Idem, pp.223). These were easy to monitor (i.e., succeed or failed), but the original case description provides no information on how this is done (Idem).

(b) The original case description (Idem) did not mention anything about accountability. From the evaluation reports of the taskforce and RIEC (Task force Brabant-Zeeland, RIEC Zeeland West-Brabant, RIEC Oost-Brabant, 2014; Zouridis, Tops & Peeters, 2013) it does not become clear to whom these collaborative initiatives had to account. Furthermore, the problem that the tripartite consultation aimed to tackle received a lot of media attention (e.g., RTL, 2014), which made that the partners in this collaboration experienced some pressure from concerned citizens and elected officials (i.e., local council). 

(c) The original case description (Cels et al., 2017, pp.215-232) provided no information about how these dynamics changed over the period observed.

The task force arrested 1,500 drugs criminals and took 135 million euros (1st year: 15 million; 2nd year: 36 million; and 3rd year: 84 million) from them. Besides, 118 buildings in which drugs was produced were closed and the BIBOB-procedure* was applied 700 times (Idem, p.222).

*BIBOB-procedure (the Public Administration Probity in Decision-Making Act) empowers local authorities to withhold or revoke a permit for any business if the owner is suspected of criminal wrongdoing or cannot prove that his or her finances are legitimate.

Local: The output of the tripartite consultations was a closing of the motorcycle clubhouse. 

(b) Regional: As mentioned above, both the RIEC and the task force achieved some results in their fight against organized crime. The partners in these collaborations, however, had to admit that the societal challenge (i.e., drugs related crimes in Noord-Brabant) was not effectively addressed. Besides, one of the stakeholders observed that the illegal practices were so lucrative for the drugs criminals that the partners almost felt that it was a lost cause (Idem, p.223).

Local: An outcome of the joint action of the tripartite consultation is that the motorcycle clubhouse of No Surrender is closed because of the absence of the required liquor and catering license (Idem, pp.231-232). The leader of No Surrender expected that the motorcycle club would be unable to prove that it complies with the requirements of the local government (Idem, p.232). It thus seemed that the three partners (i.e., municipality, police and public prosecution service) found a legitimate way to reach their goal (Idem, pp.230-232). 

(c) A major change is that various joint actions (in Dutch: klapdagen) were undertaken in which several public organizations were involved (Idem, p.222). However, the question arises what the collective outputs and social outcomes are over time. Thus far, it does not seem that the collaborations stopped or even reduced drugs related crimes in Noord-Brabant (Idem, p.222).

Members of the aquaculture industry seeking more representation in the regulatory decision making processes impacting their practices supported the creation of the partnership. Members of the aquaculture industry, state agriculture and environmental agencies, and academic institutions collaborate in the partnership to develop aquaculture development plans and official policies to manage the practices and development of the aquaculture industry in the state in which the partnership in housed, and issues arising in connection with the industry. When the partnership was created there was an explicit attempt to frame aquaculture as an agricultural issue instead of a natural resource issue, as it was previously characterized. In connection with this reframing, the partnership was housed within the state department of agriculture. Viewing aquaculture as an agricultural activity would mean emphasizing the economic/marketing aspects of the industry, instead of environmental aspects. However, while industry development, marketing, and the development of policies relating to each of these activities was a primary focus of the partnership, it also dealt with a variety of other issues associated with the industry more broadly on an as needed basis. Example of issues relating to the aquaculture industry, which the partnership also advised on to various degrees, include:  degradation of marine ecosystems, aquatic health, conflict among resource users, and conflict in coastal development priorities. 

The partnership was actively involved in producing recommendations and statements to the State agencies on issues of interest to them. The partnership also submitted draft policies and best management practices to be considered for adoption at the state level, including a producer marketing initiative and revisions to land use regulations. In terms of physical outputs, a marketing initiative and an aquaculture development zones leasing policy were cited as being noteworthy accomplishments.  Generally, partnership participants note that the process for developing these outputs was a slow one. 

While the partnership was developed more as a mechanism to generate policies pertaining to the development of the aquaculture industry, and not necessarily as a forum for diverse aquaculture stakeholders to resolve conflict or improve relations among each other, partnership partnerships did note positive relational outcomes resulting from the collaborative process. They noted that having a forum to engage in sustained dialogue was important for generating desired outputs. Indeed, partnership members cited the ability to engage a diverse group of stakeholders in discussions regarding aquaculture issues as the group's biggest accomplishment. 

";6;6;Externally directed by law or authority;3;3;;4;4;3;4;4;4;;Off;4;Mostly confident;"The partnership was created through legislation. Participation in the council is determined by professional affiliation or by appointment. Four positions are occupied by representatives from state agencies; in other words, the individuals that occupy these positions do so by default of their professional roles. Some seats are also reserved for individuals in academic/research institutions. The remainder of the participants are appointed by the Governor or policymakers. The prehistory and past interactions of participants is unknown, however partnership participants reported engaging significantly in formal and informal coordination around partnership issues and documents. The coordinator of the partnership noted that the success of the partnership was linked to the participation of industry members, who are highly competent in the operational aspects of aquaculture production. The coordinator noted the complexity of regulatory issues which the partnership dealt with and thus the need for industry expertise in regulatory decision making. Conversely, one of the participants noted that having the authority and the commitment of regulatory bodies was also important for advancing industry interests. Thus, partnership participants appeared to rely on each other for different types of resources. Regulatory officials relied on industry, and researchers, for topical expertise. Industry relied on government agencies for political support and authority resources. 

Participants did not note major changes in the dynamics reported here throughout the duration of the partnership process that was studied.

Partnership participants also indicated, however, that decisions were often reached by consensus. 

The partnership was designed to be inclusive of government agency representatives, academics, and industry members. Partnership participants noted various dynamics regarding the composition and perceived inclusivity of the partnership. One of these dynamics was over-representation of agency representatives. This sentiment was mostly expressed by members of the aquaculture industry. According to industry members, the over-representation of agency officials associated with an imbalance in viewpoints represented as well as an over-reliance on administrative processes and protocols (i.e., ""red tape""). Additionally, participants noted relatively high turn over among agency representatives along with change in government.

The partnership process was led by an agency official, which influenced the partnership process/outputs according to one partnership participant. The following quotation is illustrative of this point: ""I think the head of the [partnership] being in the hands of the the state agencies has some benefits but it also tempers what the [partnership] can say. Things tend to be put in watered down language rather than being blunt. And so if it was in the hands of the producer [industry member] or something I think you would see something very different...but then again you might not have the participation of the state agencies...so it is a double-edged sword and whether the producer community would be able to step up and do that...I don't know...""

Partnership meetings were not typically attended by all participants. Also, many partnership participants noted changes in participation over time; more specifically, declining participation over time. 

Partnership participants also noted various stakeholders that were not included in the partnership process that should have been; mostly by members of industries related to aquaculture or by individuals from other parts of the industry. Examples of the latter include trout growers and ornamental fish producers. Participants also noted a desire to have additional high level executives (ex. Commissioners) and policymakers participate in the partnership process. Further, while some participants identified a a lack of formal inclusion of the above types of stakeholders in the partnership process, others noted that meetings were open to any interested parties.

This person was responsible for facilitating meetings and setting agendas for partnership meetings. However, according to partnership participants, agendas were constructed with feedback from participants; in other words, they were not entirely decided upon by the partnership Chair. Partnership participants noted that the Chair in place prior to the beginning of the study period, but what would be appear to be the middle of the collaboration period examined, was particularly effective in facilitating the work of the partnership. Partnership members noted that he was effective at getting things done, while also delegating tasks as needed among other partnership members. The partnership, in addition to hosting large group deliberations, also relied on a committee structure. Specific tasks relevant to the work of the council were addressed by sub-committees. Many of the partnership participants made remarks about the personality of this leader being conducive to the partnership's generation of policy outputs.

With respect to coordination networks, the majority of industry members indicated that they tended to coordinate most with other producers. Some industry members also mentioned coordinating with University researchers and a state agency representative (from the Department of Environmental Protection) currently serving on the Council. Coordination in most cases was attributed to shared beliefs and/or areas of expertise. Coordination varied from informal discussions between coordinating parties to working together to produce policy recommendations and/or statements. 

With respect to policy outputs, as noted previously, the partnership has been very effective. However, partnership participants note that these outputs were not quickly generated. Instead, they were heavily deliberated over the collaboration period assessed.

These plans (or reports) were also mandated through the legislation establishing the partnership. The following statement taken from one aquaculture development plan conveys how they are utilized toward partnership oversight: ""This report [aquaculture development plan], periodically required pursuant to the [partnership establishing] Act, is developed by the [partnership] and is being presented to the Governor, Legislature, and to the citizens of the State...to describe the progress that has been in aquaculture development, what is still possible, and to set forth recommendations for more fully achieving aquaculture's potential.""

It was designed to address the development of policy to encourage the economic development of the industry and marketing of aquaculture products. Relating to these specific objectives, the partnership generated plans, reports, and recommendations. The partnership also developed policy recommendations on other types of issues relating to the aquaculture industry on as needed basis; for example, aquatic health and land use. However, partnership participants clearly viewed the marketing related outputs to be the partnership's biggest accomplishment. 

Beyond the tangible outputs referenced above, that relate specifically to the primary charge of the partnership, participants reported various social learning outcomes resulting from their participation in the partnership process. A major focus of the research project entailing a study of the partnership was assessing scientific and policy learning among partnership participants. Partnership participants expressed varying degrees of scientific/technical and policy learning as a result of participating in the partnership. Most of the time learning was said to be a product of being able to hear differing viewpoints and engage in frank discussions with other partnership members. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A range of  national and local policy initiatives have been launched to counter these problems, including area-based participatory modes of governance and bottom-up participation. In the capital of Stockholm, a number of such participatory initiatives have been implemented in the city’s most deprived neighborhoods. The case reported here is one example. It was called ""The Neighborhood Renewal Program""  (in Swedish Stadsdelsförnyelsen), and it was carried out in nine administrative districts in Stockholm that were, and still is, characterized by poverty, low election turnout, and—for most districts—a high proportion of residents with a non-Swedish background. The ""Neighborhood Renewal Program"" was carried out within the overall substantive frame of ""integration/segregation policy"" but perhaps more important was the ambition to fuel the development of new methods and processes for inclusive and holistic modes of neighborhood governance (see below).

The substantive ambition(s) was to initiate a long-term development toward social inclusion, increased sustainable growth and economic development in the outer city, and to reduce the differences between different parts of the city regarding levels of employment and education, health, safety and well-being, as well as access to service, culture and leisure activities. Moreover, a stated procedural or institutional ambition was to increase the ""opportunities for citizens to really participate in local policy processes and about the ability of the local political system to achieve real collaboration between different sectors and levels. . . "" (City of Stockholm, 2003, pp. 12 and 54, our translation).

It is quite obvious that the fundamental problem of spatial city segregation is not handled through neighborhood level efforts, however broad, holistic or innovative they may be. Such solutions need to be implemented at higher levels of scale. This was also clear for central policy makers and program initiators in this case. Hence, the ambitions were rather framed as institutional or procedural and should be understood within its context. A repeated catch-word at the time was to move ""from project to process"", referring to the need for more sustainable and less symbolic engagement with the problems of ""poor"" neighborhoods. Though this stated aim were able to mobilize engagement among professionals and citizens it also produced frustration and disappointment over time. The ambition to establish sustainable structures for more collaborative neighborhood governance in this form came to an end with the election of a new political majority in town hall. In a sense, the ""Neighborhood Renewal Program"" became just another collaborative project in the history of the suburbs concerned.
";5;2;Externally directed by law or authority;3;3;Off;4;4;3;3;3;3;Off;Off;3;Reasonably confident;"In the capital of Stockholm, there is a long history of collaborative and participatory initiatives in deprived neighborhoods. In most of the nine administrative districts in Stockholm included in ""The Neighborhood Renewal Program"", both the inhabitants and the local institutional actors involved had experiences of similar attempts before. While we cannot assure that there is pre-history of collaboration among the specific individuals participating, this certainly true for institutional actors and many of the civil society associations involved. 

When the Stockholm ""Neighborhood Renewal Program"" was presented and introduced, there was an emerging narrative about ""project tiredness"" and the symbolic ""Christmas gift""-character of this kind of collaborative governance experiments. Hence, though many participants argued they had gained from previous collaboration, it was also related to frustration over limited outcomes and unclear processes.

Though the operative processes and actions in most cases actually build on already existing collaborative infrastructures, the up-scaling in terms of policy ambitions and financial support was a political initiative from the local government executive board of Stockholm. Hence, new and more intensive forms of neighborhood  collaboration were facilitated through financial as well as institutional assistance carried by and through central level politicians and senior civil servants within the Stockholm city administration. 

Although the central level architects of the program pictured a situation of intense and widespread inter-dependencies among planners, social workers, school staff, housing managers, local business, civil society and local inhabitants, etc., the perceptions of operative inter-dependencies differed between different actors and actor constellations within the case.  

Sinse the ""collaboration groups"" and more operative ""working groups"" were based on voluntary self-selection we may assume that the participating actors shared a feeling of interdependency in relation to the wealth and safety of their community in general (in the collaboration groups) or the more specific issue handled (in working groups). Though they were facilitated and seeded, collaboration was basically interdependency-driven.

At the same time the public owned housing companies were obliged to take part in the program through formal directives. Hence, the executive committee did not trust the housing companies to share its perception of inter-dependencies as incitements for self-organized collaboration. In fact it seems fair to say their local collaboration with other professionals, i.e. social workers, teachers, etc., was limited. Locally, the collaboration between the municipality owned housing companies and local inhabitants were largely carried out in ""parallel"" to the collaboration between other welfare providers and citizen groups. 

At the operative level some actors learned a new understanding of local inter-dependencies over time. However, it would not be correct to call this ""significant changes"". The tendency for ""parallel process"" of collaboration between housing companies and more social professionals suggests some strategically induced interdependencies were never operatively experienced.";6-okt;6-okt;6-okt;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;2;Off;3;3;3;3;Off;4;2;3;3;3;Off;3;Off;Highly confident;"The organizational basis for the neighborhood renewal program were (a) neighborhood level ""collaboration groups"" and (b) issue-specific ""working groups"" where civil servants from different departments and citizens could deliberate, share knowledge, define problems, develop, and to and to some extant prioritize between, policy solutions. For each of the nine neighborhoods included in the ""Neighborhood Renewal Program"" there were one collaboration group were more general visions for the neighborhoods were developed and suggestions from the more issue-specific working group discussed and, if agreed upon, suggested for the politicians in the local neighborhood council. 

Four characteristics of the ground rules are especially important: (1) It was a neighborhood-based program, with regard both to its organizational design and its objectives, as opposed to more general or sector-based programs. (2) Local citizens as well as civil servants were self-selected into the collaboration and working groups. (3) It required repeated participation in working groups, as opposed to attendance at individual meetings. (4) It was designed to collectively formulate, discuss, and prioritize local development agendas and to have an influence on local decisions concerning the use of public resources, as opposed to participation on a purely advisory or consultative basis.

Though there were civil administrators facilitating the meetings, both the collaboration and working groups were in principle ""open"". Although there was a broad participation at the aggregate level of the program, at the operative level of the working groups, the participation was more narrow, often lacking the broad inter-sectional collaboration aimed for.

There was no lack of information about the opportunities for collaboration in the concerned neighborhoods. Local officials informed the general public outwards as well as the different branches of the local public administration inwards. However, the more detailed procedures and mandates were more obscure. In interviews, different role holders explained the same organization and procedure very differently, both with reference to the decision rules within the collaboration process, and to the link between the collaborative efforts and the more traditional and vertical structures of representative democracy.

A core conclusion of the case study was that central level political leadership failed to institutionalize the collaborative processes. It seems the symbolic value of ""collaboration"" made everyone commit themselves at the design level, without  ambition to think through the more operative implications of collaboration and participation, and when, where and how to switch between different governance logics within the local regime. Instead a ""strategy of ambiguity"" concerning these rules was de facto implemented.

In some local contexts, where the ""Neighborhood ReProgram was carried out, the initial broad mobilization of different collaborating partners and citizens created a need to ""tighten up"" the structure of collaboration efforts. Rather than simply facilitating an infrastructure for more organic bottom up initiatives new positions and structures for coordination were introduced.";Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;2;3;2;Off;4;3;1;Off;4;4;2;Off;4;Off;4;2;Highly confident;"Collaborative leadership was carried out on three levels: at the central level (Town Hall), at a local strategic level; and at a local operative level. The aim to establish new and/or revitalize old collaborative structures in the nine city districts was a political initiative from the, at the time Social Democratic, political majority in Town Hall. After the initialization, however, the leadership at the central level were primarily carried out by a smaller group of senior civil servants. There was also a governing body of the heads from a number of different sectoral departments and municipality owned housing companies. However, this body did not conduct any active leadership but rather followed the collaborative activities at distance. How to design and establish the more specific collaborative structures were left to political and administrative actors at the district level to decide. 

At the district level, politicians within the neighborhood councils were somewhat more active in strategic decisions. Again, however, civil servants at the local level (""local development coordinators"") were crucial in this phase. Their local knowledge of previous experiences of collaborative neighborhood governance had substantial impact on the design of the local institutional arrangements and procedures in a particular district. Also when the local collaborative arrangements were established, in more operative phases of collaboration, the ""local neighborhood coordinators"" had an important role as facilitators. 

In some local contexts, there were irritation among activists that the operative leadership was too rigid and not sensitive enough to the unequal opportunities for  taking part in collaboration, between professionals and well-established civil organizations on the one hand, and other groups on the other. In general, the ""local development coordinators"" had an important role in linking, adjusting and re-framing local initiatives so they would fit into the overall umbrella of the ""Neighborhood Renewal Program"". 

A key ingredient of the leadership strategy of the program was the use of economic carrots. Collaborative development of new modes of local problems-solving was stimulated through the promise of project budgets if the initial ideas got accepted by local stakeholders and were in line with the centrally stated meta-goals of the program.

As mentioned above, political leadership at the central level was quite weak and indirect. In the end of the program it was not capable to protect the collaborative infrastructures built up and induced with activities. With the election 2006, a new majority took over in Stockholm and the program was ended. The new majority did not reject neighborhood renewal through collaborative governance as such but rather the distributed, organic and fragmented form they argued the Stockholm Neighborhood Renewal Program was.

Leadership dynamics also include the ""tightening up"" strategy after the initial phase of broad mobilization described above.

c) See above.";4;4;4;Off;2;2;2;Off;3;3;3;Off;4;4;4;Off;4;4;3;Off;3;5;3;5;3;Off;Off;4;3;5;3;Off;Mostly confident;"The collaborating participants met face-to-face in broader neighborhood-level ""collaboration groups"" and more functional and issue-specific ""working groups"". In general we concluded that the ""working groups"" were not arenas for confrontation between different articulated proposals. Given the nature of the policy problem(s) addressed and wide range of types of actors, conflicts were remarkably unusual. Although it sometimes happened, prioritization between articulated alternative policy proposals was not what these processes were primarily about. A key conclusion of the study was also that institutional design and collaborative leadership effectively kept  political prioritization within traditional bodies of representative democracy. 

The deliberative quality of the interactions within the collaboration was also limited. The larger ""coordination groups"" were not capable to host ""reasoning together"", while the smaller ""working groups"" in practice did not allow the multiple experiences and perspectives required for constructive communication with the ""other side"".

In practice, the interaction between collaborating participants were more functional, pragmatic and problem-solving oriented. Hence, according a survey with 389 participants in three out of nine districts in the program (243 inhabitants and 146 professionals), about 80 percent found the dialogues ""open and unbiased"" and ""focused and goal-oriented"" at the same time. And in terms of individual motives guiding the interactions, we found three groups of participants: ""Common good"" motives reflected a general desire to contribute to local development, and professional competence indicated participation on a more detached professional basis, whereas self-interest was a combination of improving one’s own political efficacy and giving voice to one’s own group. It is illustrative that the overall evaluation of the program was highest in the first group.  

Rules for decision-making in the program was somewhat obscure. Within the operative and more project-specific working groups, 70 percent of the participants answered that had been involved in ""decision-making"". Formally, however, these decisions were suggestions for the politicians of the neighborhood councils. In the vast majority of the cases, the neighborhood councils followed the suggestions of the working groups and financed specific development projects but in the end only few of the projects were turned into regular policy decisions.

In some neighborhoods new coordination mechanisms were introduced to handle what was perceived as a large and fragmented set of too narrow collaborative initiatives. Hence, the processes were ""steered up"" so that projects related to housing, social security, education, etc. were linked to each-other. In that sense, the interactions became less spontaneous and bottom-up driven after some time.";4;4;2;Off;3;3;3;Off;2;4;4;Off;4;4;4;1;1;1;Off;Off;4;4;4;Off;4;4;4;Off;1;5;2;5;1;1;2;4;2;1;4;2;Off;Off;Off;Off;Highly confident;"The formulation of central strategic goals of the Stockholm ""Neighborhood Renewal Program"" was formulated in through traditional Swedish decision-making procedures, including a referral procedure with all relevant city departments and municipality owned housing companies involved before majority decision in the city assembly. 

The program was monitored financially by controllers of the executive committee of the city as well as an external evaluation conducted by a university.

Elected officials and senior civil servants of the relevant departments and housing companies of the city at the central level were regularly informed about the development of the program, but took no active role as meta-governors after the the initial establishment of the program. 

Appointed politicians at the neighborhood level were much more actively following the operative work in the collaboration process. Some of the politicians of the neighborhood councils wanted to take part directly in collaboration but this was regarded inappropriate by the civil servants coordinating the program, at the local as well as the central levels of the city.

The ""local development coordinators"" within the city administration controlled both that the processes and the suggested projects were in line with the overall and general aims of the program. At the final stage, when participants had developed a proposal, local politicians were able to approve or not. The participants were accountable to each other within the collaborative process and to local program-leaders that followed and guided the collaboration so it would be in line with the overall agenda and be approved be the neighborhood council politicians.

Some outputs were innovative solutions and methods that could be implemented in the regular public administration. Others became short projects and test beds that did not survived. Only a few projects led to approved policy changes. 

The case study had as main focus the organization problem of the program rather than specific outputs or even less long-term outcomes.

The case study research did not cover outcomes. However, the fact that the infrastructure of this collaborative effort was canceled with the new majority it seems unlikely that any substantive outcomes were achieved. In terms of local knowledge about how to carry out this type of efforts, however, it was probably more successful. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In order to prepare for the amalgamation, the smaller municipal council in Svelvik  initiated a number of innitiatives aiming to give the local community as favourable a postion in the new larger municipality as possible. One of the initiatives was the formation of several task committees composed of five politicians and ten citizens. One of these committees was commissioned to develop a plan for a new town house. Inspiration to form a task committee came from Gentofte municipality in Denmark.

The remit of the task committee was to develop propositions of what a new town house could look like and what activities it should contain. In the remit, the overall purpose of the town house is described as that of creating an innovative place that enhances the attractiveness of the town center of Svelvik. As a part of this endeavour, the town house should contribute to improving local public services, providing good localities for culture and leisure activities, and promoting local democracy.  Moreover, the task committee was asked to explore posibilities for locating a service in the same locality as leisure activities in order to promote co-production and co-creation. Finally, its mission was to develop a policy proposal in close dialogue with the citizens of Svelvik to harvest innovative ideas, enjoyed, broad public support, and reflected local needs.

The remit stressed that the task committee should not consider location, but assume that building will be located in the town centre of Svelvik. Moreover, the mission statement specifies that the task committee is in charge of an explorative phase - a so called mapping of options. An architect company has been commissioned to develop a concrete proposal for the layout of a town house that builds on input form the task committee. The proposal will then be forwarded to the municipal council, who will deside how to move forward. The task committee actively uses this remit as a guideline for their work although they find it difficult not to discuss location. At some point midway in the process, the mayor proposes that the committee is free to consider location, but the committe decides to stick to the original remit that clearly states that they shouldn't.

The task committee started its work in January 2018 and reports its work to the municipaIity  council in June 2018. They popose to develop the town house into the ""heart of Svelvik"" with multiple services and activities for different generations and easy assess for everybody. There should be three functionalities in the town house: A culture scene, a living room, and work- and meeting facilities. The proposal stresses the importance of flexibility and multifunctionality of and interconnectedness beween the different spaces and activities. If it is necessary to prioritize, the proposal notes that priority should be given to the culture scene and the living room while office space and public services should be located elsewhere in the town centre. 

In august, 2018, the policy proposal is taken up at a meeting in the municipal council and is  taken ad notam without discussion. In the following weeks there are intense debates and contestations related to the issue of location. The city manager proposes to follow the committee's proposal, but leading politicians disagree. Late in the fall, it is decided to form a work group of politicians to prepare a final decision. 
  
 



";2;3;Externally directed by law or authority;4;4;Off;4;4;4;3;3;4;Off;Off;4;Highly confident;"The historical background is that Svelvik have been through a series of bad experiences that have brought politicians and citizens into conflict. The conflicts rose to an all time high when the politicians built a new school and then decided never to open it because of cut backs. Therefore, the municipality decided to change the way it develops policies to avoid future conflicts with the citizens and to make better decisions. It adopted the Gentofte Model (see case #), and introduced task committeess that aim to promote collaborative policy-making between citizens and politicians. The municipality council formed three task committees in 2016 and positiv experiences form this first round of task commmittes encouraged the municipal council to introduce two new task committees in 2018. The background for asking a task committee to develop a town house policy was that the upcoming amalgamation reform would most likely move parts of public service delivery and cultural activities from Svelvik to the main city of Drammen. As such, the committee was part of a broader endeavour to assure a concentration of social activity in the centre of Svelvik, whcih would enhance chances that it would  survive as a place of importance and identification for the local citizens.

The collaboration was initiated by the municipal council who wanted to mobilise the ideas, resources, support and ownership of the citizens of Svelvik in deciding how to promote Svelvik as a vibrant local town under the new conditions. They invited 10 carefully selected citizens with different backgrounds but a shared commitment to promote community activities to work with 5 politicians on developing a policy proposal, and seek to involve as many citizens as possible in the process.

There was from the very start, a strong feeling of interdependency between the members of the town house committee. The local town was threatened and it was a collective objective to do something about it by proposing a new town house that could ensure that the town would not move towards decay and depopulation. They all wanted Svelvik to be an attractive place to live and visit and with active citizens with strong community sentiments.   

As the collaboration progressed the sense of interdependency was further reinforced by positive experiences and a collaborative spirit. The participating five politicians as well as the involved stakeholders found that their views and interests were taken into account, and they even managed to agree on what to leave out if they had to prioritize. However, some of the stakeholders who were not involved in the process, and also a few of those who were, were reluctant to break with status quo because they risked losing what they had. They used the media and loobying of powerful politicians who were not members of the committee to disrupt the process in the municipal council when the collaborative policy making process was concluded. ";16-20;20+;16-20;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;4;4;Off;4;5;5;4;Off;4;5;5;5;4;Off;4;Off;Highly confident;"The ground rule of the collaboration was defined in the remit formulated by the Municipal Council. The remit gave the committee 6 months to prepare a proposal regarding what activities there should be in the new town house. Moreover, the remit specified inclusion critieria for selecting the 10 citizens in the form of 10 competence profiles. The goal was to recruit citizens with different backgrounds but also a history of active engagement in the local community. The politicians were to be appointed by the different politial parties, and one of the politicans were designated to be committee chair. It was stressed in the remit that the task committee should not to consider the future location and physical lay out of the town house. This would be decided by the municipal council. Moreover, the remit pointed out that the committee should serve as orchestrator of a much larger engagement of local actors. Otherwise the committee was free to decide how it would work. As another ground rule, the committee was mandated to present work in process reports to the municipal council at two specified stages in the process.  

The committee decided to involve a broad range of citizens in the work by organizing an urban lab, make vox-pop interviews with people on the street and in school busses, pay visits to public service institutions, participate in meetings with the youth council, take part in workshops with NGOs and public employees, and host discussion salons among specific groups of citizens. Another ground rule outlined in the remit was that the committee should seek inspiration from other municialities, but a planned excursion was eventually chancelled because it proved to be to costly. Some of the facilitating adminsitrators and one of the citizens in the committee joined a training program on public innovation.  

The committee meetings as well as the other events hosted by the committee were open, which is a legal requirement in Norway, and minutes were made of all meetings. All external activities were posted in the local newspaper, but the local media showed relatively little interest in communicating such activities. The media did not show much interest until critical voices were heard from different stakeholders, and the political conflict in the municipal council broke out.

Another politician was appointed co-chair. A public administrator and later on a consultant from the achitect firm took part in facilitating the process. The committee chairs planned the meetings in close collaboration with the public administrator. The leadership style was extensively collaborative and a lot of time at the meetings was spend discussing how to proceed. Some members found these discussions too time consuming and would have prefered stronger preliminary process planning and that more had been done to avoid repetitions and promote progress. Too much time was spend on idea development and too little on considering what was possible in terms of financing and location. There was general satisfaction with the process facilitation and administrative assistance, however. Some members found that there could have been more emphasis on creating creative spaces in order to promote innovation. One of the citizens in the committee says that it would have been nice if one of the citizens have taken part in preparing the meetings. 
 
The main leadership challenge was not managerial or facilitative however. It seems to be a lack of political leadership on the side of the municipal council and the participating politicians/chairs in the sense that the work in the committee appears to come out of touch with the municipal budget and overall political sentiments in the municipal council regarding location. Also efforts to deal with critical voices among stakeholder groups remained weak. In the months after the committee had presented its proposal to the municipal council a huge conflict arose between two proposals regarding how to proceed. In light of the fact that ther was resistanse to chnge among some stakeholders, and that a house with the thee proposed functionalities would end up costing the double and need a huge building, the politicians fought over whether to follow the prioritized solution proposed by the committee or to chose another strategy. As a result of this conflict a decision has been postponed, and a committee of politicians is discussing how to proceed. The citizens and politicians who participated in the committee expressed strong frustrations with this state of affairs.";5;5;5;Off;3;4;3;Off;5;5;4;Off;5;5;4;Off;4;4;4;Off;3;4;2;4;4;Off;Off;4;2;4;2;Off;Highly confident;"The 10 citizens and 5 politicians met on a regular basis in the City Hall or in the library. They were facilitated by a leading adminstrator and a person from the architect firm. The administrator who assisted the committee remained unsure throughout the process how much to take part in the discussions. The committee planned 7 meetings - one of them being an excursion that was later cancelled. At the first meeting, the committee formulated a shared goal for the collaboration process and what activities to initiate. At the second meeting, they developed a stakeholder map. At the third meeting they mapped the needs that a town house should meet, and at the fourt meeting they prioritized between functions. At the fifth meeting, they detailed room functions and a program for the different functions. At the final meeting they were endorsing a policy proposal that was formulated by the architectural firm. 

In the interviews, the participants expressed high satisfaction with the collaboration in the committee, although they felt that they did not feel that they had been sufficiently involved in formulating and presenting the the final report to the municipal council. Both politicians and citizens found that it was a pleasant process and that they had learned a lot. The citizens agreed, however, that the politicians were highly reluctant to speak their mind and functioned too much as a kind of obervants, which made it difficult to find out what they thought. They become more active over time. The politicians explain that they wanted to make sure that the citizens had this chance to voice their ideas and views. A citizen as well as a politician found it difficult to determine whether the members of the committee represented a group or just themselves in the discussions. Many of the citizens stated that they thought that it had been very difficult to consider functions of a town house without considering funding and location when it was clear that these factors matter. One citizen who had once been a politician explains that she suspected that tehy were engaging in wishful thinking rather than reality.

Throughout the process, the leadership and the administration kept a keen eye on the formal goals for the collaborative process, and constantly reminded the participants of these commitments and goals. As required in the remit, the committee reported its work to the municipal council at two points in time in the work process, but not to any of the standing committees and the individual politicians reported that they did not discuss the committee work with their fellow party members as the process progessed. Some of the citizens reported back to their organizations with regular intervals, but others did not, which hampered the creation of a broader ownership to the policy. The committee was eager to report its work to the public but the media showed very limited interest. The media coverage did not really get going until the conflict escalated in the aftermath of the collaboration process.

They also prioritized between different solutions although it was not a requirement. All members of the committe supported the policy proposal. The outcome of the process is another matter because the poposal has stirred intense conflicts in the municipal council and resistance from some stakeholders. This is among other things due to battles regarding the posible location of the town house that was not a part of the task but would have marked consequences for form some stakeholder groups. As is the rule in Norway, the City Manager proposed that the proposed prioritation of the task committee was followed, but  it was countered by an alternative proposal from a committee of leadning politicians. This situation has produced a political deadlock situation, and the many citizens and politicians who have participated ended up being deeply frustrated.

Expansion of the network (essentially a process of upscaling from local/regional to national level) built from personal relationships (people bringing in new individuals whom they trusted based on previous interactions). Prior relationships were essentially among actors in the Swedish crisis management system as well as local level contacts (between municipalities in the same region/county). Yet many new relationships were formed as well. Our survey material shows that when reconstructing the collaborative (social) network among a selection of 129 key individuals involved in the wildfire response, 46% of these individual ties were new relationships (i.e. emerged between actors that had not collaborated before in the past). 
b. Initially by activating standardized protocols for emergency response (e.g. collaboration conferences among actors to share information and make joint situation assessments), subsequently driven/coordinated by an ad hoc ""headquarters"" organization, which emerged gradually as the need for coordination increased.
c. Our survey data included a question regarding different incentives to collaborate and how well the respondents dealt with each challenge: (1) initiate contact with individuals; (2) reach agreement on joint goals and working-methods; (3) share information; (4) coordinate activities; (5) solve conflict. Of these, initiate contact with individuals (1) and reach agreement on joint goals and working-methods (2) worked well while sharing of information (3) was most problematic/challenging.
d. The network grew rapidly over a period of just a few days as more actors/orgs were pulled into the wildfire response. In addition, the survey included one question re the changing overall ability of the collaborative network to solve the tasks. The majority of the respondents (circa 80%) indicated that the overall performance increased over time; 10% indicated performance remained the same over the period; 2,5% indicated that performance decreased over time.";nov-15;20+;20+;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;2;Off;2;3;2;2;Off;4;3;2;1;2;Off;1;Off;Mostly confident;"a. ground rules were a mix of formal guidelines and practices, regulated through the crisis management system, and more informal rules based on e.g. personal relationships. Rules were gradually elaborated and added, as the crisis response organization grew. 
b. the organization became more inclusive through time. Inclusion or participation in the wildfire response essentially a question about responding to urgent needs (for example the need for more personnel, expertise, or resources). Yet, while many actors participated on site not everyone felt they had full insight into the process of collaboration.
c. the structure of the collaborative responder organization was fairly transparent, actors in charge were explicit with organization and procedure for decision-making. However, some actors experienced some degree of uncertainty concerning responsibilities and roles. 
d. the architecture of the responder organization changed dramatically as the need to achieve coordination among a growing number of stakeholders increased. This led to the creation of an ad hoc ""headquarters"" organization, spearheaded and coordinated by regional level actors with formal responsibility for coordination and collaboration in times of crisis.";Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;2;2;2;Off;2;2;2;Off;3;4;4;Off;4;Off;4;4;Mostly confident;"a. a mix of formal and informal leaders. The need for leadership became more pressing a few days into the wildfire, as the complexity (number of actors) of the response grew. Outside actors with previous experience were brought in from different regions to lead the collaborative work. These actors essentially opted for a ""hands-off"" leadership style, by delegating authority and responsibility to other individuals.
b. the new ad hoc organization provided clarity in leadership since it defined areas of responsibility and a structure for achieving coordination. 
c. the need for leadership increased as more actors became involved in the response. This was handled by forming a more structured ad hoc organization, with a clear leadership structure and division of responsibility across different tasks";2;2;2;Off;2;1;1;Off;2;2;2;Off;3;4;4;Off;1;2;1;Off;1;4;3;5;3;Off;Off;2;1;5;3;Off;Reasonably confident;"a. actors collaborated around different concrete operational tasks (e.g. evacuation, communication, infrastructure), across organizational boundaries, and levels of authority. Most interactions aimed at achieving coordination - to pool resources and knowledge to address concrete tasks. Some interactions aimed at achieving a ""shared situation awareness"", by pooling information from different organizations. Interactions were based on a mix of preexisting relationships (which eased collaboration among some individuals) and new relationships. Interactions were basically driven by a more or less urgent need to address pressing operational tasks.
b. the collaborative process entailed - and benefited from - setting up a technical infrastructure for communication, an organizational structure for coordination multiple tasks across organizational boundaries, and personal relationships among individuals. The work was coordinated around several concrete operational tasks (e.g. evacuation) and an organizational structure was set up to deal with each task respectively as well as ensuring coordination among actors dealing with separate tasks. This organization evolved gradually, as it became clear what were the most pressing tasks. 
c. the process of collaboration quickly became more complex as more organizations and actors joined the crisis response, which raised the need for a clear organizational structure. This resulted in the establishment of an ad hoc ""headquarters"" organization with clear leadership roles and resources linked to different operational tasks. Hereby, the process changed from being more reactive (in terms of responding to a rapidly escalating situation) to more proactive (based on defined operational tasks and semi-long term planning concerning allocation of personnel and other resources).";1;1;1;Off;2;2;2;Off;1;2;2;Off;1;1;1;1;1;2;Off;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;2;2;Off;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"a. ""goals"" in this case were largely based on broad agreement among actors concerning the overarching goal to contain the wildfire and minimize damage. Some dialogue was needed to formulate specific goals linked to individual operational tasks, which also required some level of coordination across organizational boundaries. Monitoring was limited but carried out through the ad hoc headquarters organization.
b. there was some critique towards the collective crisis response through the news media and social media, albeit limited. Several public inquiries and investigations were launched months after the wildfire
c. the gradual development of the headquarters organization brought some level of disagreement between actors at the regional (county) and local (municipality) levels, particularly concerning the ""ownership"" of the collective process and responsibility for certain tasks. The main critique from the local level actors was that they experienced that they provided information to the regional-level organization, as a basis for contributing to shared situation awareness (common operational picture, which is a standardized tool for achieving coordinated crisis management in Sweden), but they did not get anything in return. That is, the information they provided did not benefit their work at the local level. However, these disagreements did not seem to hamper performance in any way.";2;4;4;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;1;1;Off;1;2;3;Off;1;1;1;Off;Off;1;2;2;Off;3;5;5;Off;1;1;1;Off;;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;1;1;1;1;1;2;2;2;1;1;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;3;3;Off;Off;Off;1;3;3;3;3;3;1;1;1;1;Off;1;1;Off;Off;;2;4;4;3;4;4;1;1;1;2;3;3;Off;2;3;3;Off;Off;Off;Off;Reasonably confident;"a. the main results in this case concerned the ability to allocate personnel, expertise and other resources to address concrete operational tasks linked to the wildfire as efficiently and effectively as possible. In addition, several concrete tasks were directly associated with the collaborative process as such, including for instance managing inter-organizational relationships, coordinating information, and achieving shared situation awareness. 
b. our survey data provides an opportunity to explore how the actors' themselves perceived the wildfire response, considering each operational task respectively. Specifically, respondents (n=129) were asked to indicate how effective the collective response was in relation to each separate task. These (self-reported) measures of goal-attainment indicate that the response was most effective in relation to ""media contacts"", ""public information"", and ""social- and psychological care"". ""Clarifying areas of responsibility in relation to other organizations"" and ""establishing shared situation awareness"" were among the tasks that worked less well. 
c. in the survey respondents were also asked to indicate whether the collective (defined in the survey as each individual and his/her immediate surrounding) capacity to cope with shared tasks/problems changed throughout the acute phase of the wildfire. The great majority (80%) responded that the capacity to respond to shared tasks/problems was enhanced over time (whereas 9% responded the capacity remained unchanged, and 2% that the capacity reduced through time).

The main societal challenge is to stop internationally operating gangs that traffic, smuggle and exploit children (Cels et al., 2017, p.99). These gangs recruit children from poor families in South-East Europe and incorporate them into their ‘families’. The rules of these families are: 

1. The outside world is hostile;
2. There is nothing to expect from the police or social service organizations;
3. Stealing is a good thing to do; and,
4. You can only trust your family (Idem, p.100).

The gangs forced innocent children to beg and steal at central spots in various European cities, for example at train stations and market squares (Idem, p.100). This case is located in Amsterdam and Barcelona, but the collaborative partners acknowledged that the problem is much bigger. The partners knew that the gangs were also operating in Brussels, Rotterdam and Vienna. The flexibility of the gangs made it challenging for the collaborative partners to get a grip on the situation (Idem, p.103).

In contrast to the gangs, the public-sector organizations (i.e., local and national police and public prosecution service) that were involved in this project were less flexible. The various partners experienced that it was difficult to get support (i.e., extra capacity) from their supervisors for this project, which was seen as the main organizational issue (Idem, p.103).

(b) The stated ambitions and desired outputs and outcomes
The collaborative partners stated three ambitions:

1. Reframing the problem: the main problem is not the stealing and begging children, but the internationally operating gangs that force them to do so. In other words, the crime fighters should not focus on mobile banditry, but on human trafficking and smuggling and the related criminal exploitation of children (Idem, p.101);

2. Gaining insights into the nature and scope of the problem: the collaborative partners had no idea about the modus operandi of the gangs and therefore aimed to get insights into the nature and size of the problem (i.e., how many gangs and children are involved in these practices; and, how do they operate) (Idem, p.102);

3. Developing a problem-oriented approach: the collaborative partners worked together in an unconventional manner (i.e., collaboration between various public-sector organizations) and therefore had to develop a new, problem-oriented approach to tackle the societal problem they faced (Idem, p.103).

(c) How these challenges, issues and ambitions evolved during the period observed
The societal challenge, organizational issue and stated ambitions did not evolve during the period observed (Cels et al., 2017, pp.99-106).

The original case description (Cels et al., 2017, pp.99-106) did not provide any information on the prehistory and past interactions of participants. However, what does become clear is that they met each other at a meeting of the Expertise Center on Human Trafficking and Smuggling in January 2015 (Idem, p.101). 

(b) How the collaboration was initiated
The national public prosecutor on human trafficking and people smuggling announced his idea to start a collective fight against gangs that traffic and smuggle children and force them to do criminal acts. This announcement was made at a meeting of the Expertise Center on Human Trafficking and Smuggling in January 2015. Directly afterwards, a policeman (local police, focus: region Amsterdam) and a chief of the police (national police, focus: division alien identification and human trafficking) joint the project. A few months later, another chief of the police (national police, focus: division human trafficking and smuggling) also became part of the team (Idem, p.101). Thus, in total four public professionals and their respective organizations were involved in the collaboration.

(c) The sense of interdependence between participants and the incentives to collaborate
The original case description (Cels et al., 2017, pp.99-106) provides little information about this issue. However, it seems that the participants to some extent felt a sense of interdependence, for they were willing to collaborate. Together, they, for example, held presentations and briefings to inform other public professionals about their collaborative project (Idem, p.101).

Through them, their respective (public) organizations responsible for criminal investigations and prosecutions were involved. One of the respondents said: “We had a small but highly motivated team” (Idem, p.101). 

Thereafter, the collaborative partners contacted other stakeholders in the field (e.g., the Salvation Army, the Municipality of Amsterdam, a local care center, the Administration of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles, the Repatriation and Departure Service, the Ministry of Safety and Justice, the Municipality of Amsterdam) that could help them to provide housing and needed care for the children. These stakeholders held regular meetings (i.e., once every two months) to inform each other about the process and the progress of the collaborative project (Idem, p.104).

The significant change in the institutional architecture of the collaboration is the number of public and non-governmental organizations involved. As written before, the project started with four collaborative partners (e.g., police and public prosecution service), but gained support from other professionals operating in other public and not-for-profit domains (e.g., local government, social work and youth care) later on (see also 29b). This support was an important factor in the success of the international action that was undertaken by the police and the public prosecution service (see also 61a).

(b) How they formulated and achieved shared outcomes
The original case description (Cels et al., 2017, pp.99-106) did not provide much information on how the collaborative partners formulated and achieved shared outcomes. However, what is known is that they did formulate three desired shared outcomes, namely (1) reframing the problem; (2) gaining insights into the nature and size of the problem; and (3) developing a problem-oriented approach (Idem, pp.101-103). Furthermore, it seems that the partners (to some extent) achieved these outcomes. First, they created awareness among various stakeholders of the miserable situation of the children (i.e., reframing the problem). Second, they conducted research on the nature and scope of the problem (i.e., gaining insights). And finally, they carried out a successful international operation in which they traced an internationally operating gang, arrested two of its leaders and saved several children that were involved in these criminal practices (i.e., developing a problem-oriented approach) (Idem, pp.101-103).

(c) How the process changed over the period observed
In line with the desired outcomes (see 47b), the collaborative process can be divided into three different steps. First, the initiator had to gain support for the project and therefore had to reframe the problem (Idem, p.101). Second, after gaining some support, the collaborative partners had to obtain insights into the phenomenon and therefore conducted two studies on the nature and scope of the problem (Idem, p.102). Thirdly, the collaborative partners and its stakeholders carried out an international operation to realize a first quick win (Idem, p.103).

As mentioned before, the collaboration formulated three desired outcomes (or goals) right from the start. These were (1) reframing the problem; (2) gaining insights in the nature and scope of the problem; and (3) developing a problem-oriented approach (see also 13b and 47b). Nothing was mentioned about the monitoring of the goals of the collaboration (Cels et al., 2017, pp.99-106).

Interestingly, the number of stakeholders involved increased over the period observed. One may expect that this did change the dynamics, but nothing was explicitly mentioned about this in the original case description (Cels et al., 2017, pp.99-106).

The main output of the collaboration in terms of results produced by the collaborative governance process was the joint operation in Barcelona. Because of the insights that were gained about the gangs and their modus operandi and the support that was gained from various stakeholders for the international operation, the collaborative partners were able to trace a gang, arrest two of its leaders and save several innocent children (Cels et al., 2017, p.99). This quick win received national media attention and was seen as a first success of the collaborative process (Idem, pp.105).

 (b) The outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences
The collaborative partners acknowledged that it is difficult to determine what the impact of this joint operation was in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy. They had their first success (see also 61a), but they still had no grip on the internationally operating gangs (Idem, p.100). This may have the effect of displacing the problem rather than resolving it (Idem, p.106). Moreover, in spite of these short term successes, it remained difficult to obtain additional operational capacity to further develop the approach and extend the collaboration

(c) The changes to collective outputs and social outcomes over time
The main changes to the collective outputs and social outcomes over time were related to the desired outputs and outcomes (see also 13b):
1. Reframing of the problem: the collaborative partners succeeded in reframing the problem (i.e., shift from mobile banditry to human trafficking and smuggling) (Idem, p.99);
2. Gaining insights into the nature and scope of the problem: the collaborative partners succeeded in conducting research on the nature and scope of the problem (i.e., two reports, one on the socioeconomic conditions of the criminal families, and one on child exploitation) (Idem, p.102); 
3. Developing a problem-oriented approach: the collaborative partners succeed in developing and operationalizing a problem-oriented approach (i.e., joint operation in Barcelona) (Idem, p.105).

(a) societal challenges and organizational issues

- The lack of public and political awareness of human trafficking as an urgent yet persistent societal problem, also or perhaps especially so in the Netherlands;
- The limited cooperation within government and between public-sector and private-sector organizations in the fight against this problem;
- The dominant focus on repressive action and enforcement of criminal law as solutions to the problem;
- The difficulty to measure real successes in the fight against human trafficking, beyond arrests, court cases, sentences etc.;
- The lack of appropriate skills among public prosecutors to innovate in the fight against human trafficking.

(b) stated ambitions and desired outputs and outcomes

- Changing public perception about human trafficking in order to garner political support;
- Realizing collaboration among public-sector organizations and engaging private-sector organizations to collectively fight against human trafficking;
- Balancing the effort to prosecute perpetrators with efforts to protect victims and prevent human trafficking, especially under resource constraints;
- Measuring successes in novel ways;
- Equipping the new generation of public prosecutors with the skills to operate innovatively in an increasingly complex law enforcement environment.

(c) evolution of challenges, issues and ambitions during the period observed

Challenges, issues and ambitions evolved over time, throughout the three cases. At the start of the period discussed in the case study, the focus was primarily on creating awareness for human trafficking as an urgent, yet persistent societal problem and increasing public and political support for the fight against this problem. Thereafter, the public prosecutors focused on bringing together the public and private partners that could help them to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking, and, beyond that, to jointly develop an approach that was more preventative. This also raised issues around measuring effects (Waardenburg et al. 2018) and, more broadly, with regard to public problem solving and the collaborative process (Waardenburg et al., forthcoming).

The three public prosecutors had been working with each other before as part of their regular jobs. Other potential participants were invited to join the collective crime fight, among others during a meeting in which one of them, a chief public prosecutor, presented shocking photos and stories about human trafficking in the Netherlands to high-level representatives of various Dutch law enforcement authorities (Groenleer & De Jong, 2013, p.4). Relevant private-sector partners (i.e., hotels, landlords, physicians, abortion clinics) were approached per case. 

(b) how the collaboration was initiated

After the publication of a U.S. Department of State’s (2005) Trafficking in Persons Report, which showed that the Netherlands could do much more in fighting human trafficking, especially for its 25,000 commercial sex workers, of whom an estimated 50 to 80 percent were trafficking victims, the protagonists posed the question: why had their efforts to tackle this problem been so inadequate (Groenleer & De Jong, 2013, p.3)? This set in motion the three consecutive cases described in the case study.

(c) the sense of interdependence between participants and the incentives to collaborate

Right from the start, the initiators found that a host of public and private parties, either consciously or unconsciously, facilitate human trafficking (Ibid, p.3). They therefore aimed at developing a novel, integrated approach in which there would be close cooperation with both public-sector and private-sector parties (Ibid, p.4). A key incentive for these parties to collaborate was the media attention that was generated to put the human trafficking problem on the public and political agenda (Ibid, p.4). This was an effective incentive, as none of the public and private parties wanted to be seen as an enabler of human trafficking. 

(d) any significant changes over time in the period observed

The interaction between the three public prosecutors did not significantly change over time, apart from changes in their own positions (one of them became the chief of the Public Prosecution Service). At all periods observed the Dutch Public Prosecution Service took the lead in the collaboration with other parties. The prosecutors invited other public-sector and private-sector parties to join the team if they thought that it was necessary to do so. As a result, the composition of the collaboration varied per case.

The following ground rules can be derived from the three follow-up cases:
- Potential public and private partners need to be relevant, able and willing to fight against human trafficking;
- All partners that are involved in the operational action need to support the action that the collaboration is going to undertake (and otherwise the action plan needs to be rediscussed, see Irina.com case) (Groenleer & De Jong, 2013, p.2);
- All partners that are involved in the operational action share knowledge and expertise with each other (Idem, p.4);
- Both repressive and preventative repertoires need to be represented in the collaboration (Idem, p.3);
- Media attention is attracted to gain public and political support for the actions;

(b) The inclusiveness of the collaborative forum(s)

Little information is given about the inclusiveness of the collaborative forum(s). It seems that the public and private partners relevant to the problem definition were included in the operations that are discussed in the case study. However, for the second case (i.e., Irina.com), it turned out that some important private partners (i.e., international hotel groups) were not included at the outset, but agreed on a partnership later on (Idem, pp.6-7).

(c) The transparency of decision making within the collaborative forum(s)

Few insights are provided into the transparency of the decision making within the collaborative forum(s). However, in the second case (i.e., Irina.com case) it seemed that something went wrong in the decision-making process, because one of the main public partners (i.e., police) threatened to withdraw their support just a few hours before the launch of an action (Idem, p.2). The reason for the police to react in this way is that they did not know whether this problem, illegal hotel prostitution, was a real problem at all; whether this was an appropriate role for them to take; how the public would respond to this action; and how the media would influence the future relationships between the police and the hotels (Idem, p.2). This example shows that some fundamental dilemmas were not tackled during the decision-making process.

(d) Any significant changes in the institutional architecture of collaboration over time

The institutional architecture of the collaboration did not significantly change over time. In all three cases there was a so-called ‘on-the-fly collaboration’, which means that the groups were temporary, fluid and diffuse and that various partners connected because of a shared interest. The reason for the public and private partners to join the collaboration was because of their shared interest in the fight against human trafficking.

Not so much is written about the form and style of leadership within the collaboration in the case study of Groenleer & De Jong (2013). However, it seems that the three leading figures of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service acted as the (informal) leaders of the collective fight against organized crime. For the second case, it is mentioned that there were ‘lengthy’ discussions between onee of the public prosecutors and the leader of the police team (Idem, p.5). We therefore suppose that in this case there was a shared leadership role between these two persons.

Too little information is provided to describe the dynamics and impact of leadership on the collaborative process.

The collaborative process differed per case. 

- Sneep case: in this case there was an operational cooperation between the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the investigation partners. According to these partners, they did not know exactly what their new roles entailed and therefore quickly returned to old ways of working. Besides, the partners felt that the collaboration caused a lot of fuss and that they were held responsible to clean up the mess (Groenleer & De Jong, 2013, p.4). In short, in this process there was some room for improvement in the interaction between the various actors.
- Irina.com case: in this case there was an intense interaction between the leader of the public prosecution team and the leader of the police team. These two persons had weekly meetings and during these appointments they shared thoughts on their ambitions and actions (Idem, pp.5-6). After the operation, some international hotels and the Dutch Hotel and Restaurant Association joined the collaboration. Together, they developed an instructional video and organized a symposium on illegal hotel prostitution (Idem, p.7).
- Philippine sailors case: in this case one public prosecutor took the lead and contacted several relevant public partners about the human trafficking issue that was under investigation. As a result, the Water Police, the Dutch Embassy in Manila, the Social Security Agency and the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service were involved in the operation (Idem, p.8). In contrast to the hotel sector, the inland shipping sector has not become a partner of the law enforcement(Idem, p.9).

(b) How they formulated and achieved shared outcomes
Too little information was given to find out how the desired outcomes were formulated. About the achieved shared outcomes, the following can be found:

- Sneep case: a joint operation led to the first arrests and six defendants were eventually found guilty of human trafficking, receiving sentences varying from eight months to eight years. Besides, there was quite some media attention for these arrests and therefore the issue entered the political agenda in a number of major Dutch cities (Idem, p.4).
- Irina.com case: a joint ‘naming and shaming’ operation led to a text message to all phone numbers that contacted Irina.com and to three-day during action in several hotels with actresses and pseudo-clients who sent signals of illegal prostitution (Idem, p.6). This action caused a lot of media attention.
- Philippine sailors case: the collaboration led to an unannounced inspection of a large number of ships, but no exploited Philippine sailors were found. Again, journalists were informed about this operation, but they arrived at the very beginning which hindered the policemen from doing their job. Despite the fact that there we no enslaved seamen found, an employment agency faced charges. 

(c) How the process changed over the period observed
The changes in the collaborative process differed per case.

- Sneep case: the process did not change so much over time.
- Irina.com case: the hotel sector joined the collaboration after the three-day during action.
- Philippine Sailors case: the process did not change so much over time.

Too little information is given about how the goals of the collaboration were formulated. However, as stated at 13b (stated ambitions) and at 29a (ground rules), there were some shared ideas about where the teams aimed for and on what rules their acting was based. Then, about the monitoring of the goals, there was briefly mentioned that in the first case (i.e., Sneep case) team members evaluated the collaboration and their new roles (Groenleer & De Jong, 2013, p.4). For the Irina.com case, it turned out that the operation was both successful (i.e., less signs of illegal hotel prostitution) and unsuccessful (i.e., the prostitution probably continued, but now in other places – such as holiday resorts – and in other European countries – such as Germany and the UK) (Idem, p.7). Ultimately, for the Philippine sailors case, the signals of exploitation dropped, but there was no sense of urgency created within the shipping sector (Idem, p.9).

(b) How participants, elected officials, oversight bodies, and citizens held the collaboration to account

Due to the media attention that was generated, both elected officials and citizens were informed about the crime fighting operations (Idem, p.3). This also enabled the collaboration to render account to public and private partners for their actions and operations.

(c) How these dynamics changed over the period observed

Unknown.

In all three cases, the collaborative governance processes took the stated ambitions (13b) as a starting point and developed operations around them.

(b) The outcomes in terms of the impact on problem solving, goal achievement and legitimacy, taking into account any unintended consequences

The operations had a positive impact on problem solving and goal achievement, but also had unintended effects. One of the public prosecutors admitted that the signs of illegal hotel prostitution perhaps had subsided, but sexual exploitation continued. And the number of Philippine sailors being trafficked into the Netherlands may have decreased, but there are signs that sailors have gone to other countries instead, perhaps to be exploited there (Groenleer & De Jong, 2013, p.10). 

(c) The changes to collective outputs and social outcomes over time

Seven years after the start (2005-2011), the following results were realized. First, the public and political awareness of the human trafficking problem has increased. This problem is not solely related to sexual exploitation, but also to other forms of modern slavery (e.g., sailors, au pairs, agricultural workers) (Ibid, p.9). Second, the novel, integrated approach has been institutionalized in a National Task Force on Human Trafficking in 2008. In this Task Force a variety of public partners work together in the fight against human trafficking practices (Ibid, p.9). Third, the number of reported victims has increased, and the number of prosecutions has remained constant. In both cases, it is unknown whether this is the result of the operations as described above (Ibid, p.9). Ultimately, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service has learned a lot about the victims, perpetrators and enablers of trafficking, and about collaborations with public and private partners and the role of media (p.10).

The campaign argued that a public option and local control could accelerate the renewable transition and make it accessible to all, benefit the local economy, and lower prices. The focus, however, was not on a specific model of utility design, or even on municipalization as the only answer. Rather the campaign focused on the frame of exploring Minneapolis’ options during the concession process to know, and broaden, what was possible. So, rather than coming with specific ways to democratize the internal operations of a utility, they brought up these topics more generally in an effort to start a public conversation and see how they could shift that discussion by bringing up municipalization as a unique lever in this debate that would
force action from utilities. They also wanted to strategically use the city as an actor to
push the introduction of commoning practices to the energy system more broadly.

Participants in the campaign were frustrated by the non-responsiveness of the utilities and their blocking of renewables and decentralized generation, and their inefficient programs/progress to decarbonize or increase efficiency, and to make this transition accessible to all. It was clear that the utilities were the main target to address Minneapolis' carbon emissions, as they controlled at the time 2/3 of the city's emissions and their plans at the time anticipated reducing carbon intensity by only 3.6% by 2025. 

b) The goals of the campaign included: 1) City ownership and “shifting decision making” and power to a local, accountable forum 2) Localized renewable energy and democratizing the energy system 3) Educating people about perverse incentives of the current utility model 4) Shifting economic benefit away from energy monopolies to the local economy 5) Using municipalization as a wedge to force action, saying the city needed more options in its energy contracts  

c) The campaign was able to shift council opinion and build enough public and media pressure that council had to act to adopt a new approach with the investor owned utilities, but they did not agree to put the initiative to authorize municipalization on the ballot. Instead, after a period of study, the city went forward with an alternative proposal for a partnership between the two utilities and the city, with a formal board, work plans towards meeting the city’s climate and energy goals, and a community advisory council which would later become a forum for intervention for advocates.

Minneapolis Energy Options had also built up pressure on the utilities and awareness of energy issues at the city that so the utilities agreed to some important concessions in the process of negotiating with the city, including a drastic shortening and reworking of the contract to make it possible to cancel after five years. Before that even, the gas utility had agreed to some important concessions with the campaign itself, leading to the discussion at the city being focused more squarely around the possibility of municipalization of the electric utility only, which for the campaign was more strategic.

One important factor in this direction of events was a public hearing where the electric utility Xcel mobilized significant opposition from particularly the business community, and the utilities’ organization of a significant and influential oppositional campaign. Another primary factor was a state law in Minnesota that required that in municipalization proceedings, cities would have to consider lost profits to the utility, which created much financial and legal doubt about the feasibility of going the municipalization route under those circumstances.
";3;5;Self-initiated by participants;4;5;Off;5;5;2;3;5;5;Off;Off;3;Highly confident;"a) The vision and impetus of Minneapolis Energy Options came largely out of people who had been politicized in fighting against the utilities in various ways and times finding each other as they realized the importance of a window of opportunity around the renewal of franchise agreements. The campaign was started by a core group of around 7 people who started thinking of the idea separately at the same time. One sub-group knew each other through environmental justice work and more and less recent efforts to change the design and values of the energy utility system in Minnesota. Another sub group were more institutionally established within organizations doing climate, as well as local economy work. Both reached out to the Green Party member of the Minneapolis City Council and his council aide, and got connected to each other. The campaign was organized independently of city hall, but having the support of a CM's office did make a significant difference throughout the campaign.

b) This was in 2011 (Phase 1 2011-2012), and they decided to work together around an effort to urge the city and people of Minneapolis to consider what options they had in this time when the franchise agreements were coming up for renewal. They wanted to see a dramatic shift in many elements of the energy system, and they quickly come to the conclusion that doing so through by bringing up municipalization was the strongest position. This conclusion was clear for a number of reasons. The most central was that municipalization was unique in its ability to strike fear into the utilities, create leverage and force action and a larger discussion of what was needed.

c) MEO organized a coalition of about 50 social movement organizations on paper, but the size of the coalition and level of mobilization the campaign achieved was not extremely decentralized, in part because of how the process for potential municipalization was structured. In this structure, the city council would need to vote to put a question to authorize (looking into) municipalization on the ballot, and so the campaign had to first and foremost convince the city council, rather than the general public. The campaign focused on informing residents that there were other options in energy provision, starting a public and political discussion about these topics, and using various tactics to put pressure on the council, including going through the party endorsement process for the ballot initiative, and choosing to run their campaign during a municipal election year and having candidates take positions on it, so that the issue would be front and center in campaigning and election discussions. The high point of the campaign was 2013 (Phase 2). 

d) As previously mentioned the council did not vote to put the municipalization question on the ballot, but instead waited for the results of a study in Spring 2014 and in Fall 2014 formed a 
partnership between the two utilities and the city, with a formal board, work plans towards meeting the city’s climate and energy goals, and a community advisory council which would  become a forum for intervention for advocates (Phase 3 2014-present). The players were significantly different in this later period, having shifted from a grassroots team with a specific vision to a highly bureaucratized board structure of 3 large institutions (the city and the 2 utilities), and an accompanying advisory board. These large actors had histories of contention, as well as contention between the utilities and at least a segment of advocates/later board members. The campaign team formed a community organization/NGO to find ways to intervene in the city and beyond for a more democratic and renewable energy structure in 2014, and several people connected to the campaign (and new allies) became active in the advisory board. At this point city staff (both from elected's offices and various departments), various politicians on the board, and utility staff also came into larger roles. ";1-mei;20+;6-okt;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;4;Off;4;3;3;4;Off;2;4;4;3;2;Off;3;Off;Mostly confident;"a) In the campaign phases (1 and 2), there was a core steering committee that made strategic decisions in an open democratic process, eventually with one campaign staff coming on for the high point of the campaign starting at the beginning of 2013. 

Some impactful framing conditions for the campaign included: 1) a certain dynamic of catch 22  around the state law language: the city would only have standing to do a formal feasibility study with cost estimates once they had voter approval to authorize municipalization. But opponents of municipalization often liked to use this lack of cost information as the city not knowing the implications of the path they were embarking on, or on the other hand a vote to authorize municipalization locking the city into that path. For this and other reasons the campaign argued that getting authorization was about having the option to go down the municipalization path if it proved the best option. 2) There was another existing law that became a major factor in the campaign: the so-called “poison pill.” Minnesota state law around municipalization included a provision that the electric utility successfully advocated for in the 1970s that mandates that in municipalization proceedings, lost profits to the utility must be a factor in determining the buying price the city must pay, even in the eminent domain route. This law ended up being a primary reason why the council was hesitant about the municipalization route, because costs, including legal costs, might turn out to be prohibitive.

b) In a few ways the MEO campaign wasn’t necessarily a mass base campaign, but more a concerted pressure campaign. There were open interest meetings and volunteers, but much of the work was carried out by the steering committee and a surrounding circle, a group of about fifteen - twenty or so people who met weekly and made decisions in that circle. There were definitely more active volunteers and people who showed up to events (~100 active, mailing list of 2000), but they weren’t generally involved in discussions of strategic direction. These meetings were open, but there wasn’t a huge drive to get people involved on that level, rather than things like door knocking or helping out and learning to lead education/mobilization house parties. However the campaign did reach out to and bring in/present to many neighborhood and community organizations, and talked to many people on the street as primary tactics were signing postcards to the city council, and hosting educational house parties about how the current regulatory system guaranteed profits and control to energy utilities, and incentivized them to make costly, centralized investments. 

c) Decisions within the steering committee were collaborative and transparent, and a small team worked through numerous challenges like negotiating with utility executives, handling a lot of media requests, and designing input for how a partnership should look. However volunteers were not always actively engaged in this level. 

d) With the formation of the Clean Energy Partnership (board of the city and 2 utilities, supported by a staff Planning Team and a citizens' Energy Vision Advisory Council (EVAC), collaboration changed significantly. Both board and EVAC hold quarterly meetings and are open to the public, with minutes and some documents posted online.  The board is made up of 8 members: 4 from the city – including the mayor, the city coordinator or later the finance director, and 2 council representatives, with one alternate; and 2 from each utility - executives such as regional vice presidents who have in practice changed relatively frequently. The parity of votes means that things that are controversial will likely not be advanced in this space. In practice, discussions at the board level have grown more explicit, with more space for city challenges to the utilities over time, but the utilities have also consistently found ways to block more meaningful change. ";Off;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;Off;3;4;3;Off;3;4;3;Off;4;4;2;Off;5;Off;5;2;Mostly confident;"a) During the campaign - flat and distributed leadership within steering committee, central roles taken by campaign manager and some key players. 

A clear channel to a supportive council member in Minneapolis was a key dynamic, leading to an inside/outside strategy, where outside pressure was primary in changing the political landscape, but actors inside the city often led to more effective action and information, and sometimes were able to
transport campaign reasoning into city processes.

The campaign forced the government to respond. They did so selectively - the public aspect of movement demands that was seen as outside the scope of the possible, and the government was instead able to steer the process towards a partnership with the utilities that focused more squarely on emissions reductions, improving efficiency programs, and to some extent equity. The partnership however, especially with its advisory council, created an ongoing forum for the campaign to intervene from and push forward policies it saw as being able to shift power. The new form has also changed the political landscape and led to the city newly taking on energy as a core policy area, in a way that advocates hope can serve as a lever for further changes, including making the city a leader on energy (with mixed results). 

b) EVAC did broaden the scope of actors who could be involved in having a voice on energy policy in the city. The committee was something that the MEO campaign pushed for, and was relatively uncontroversially accepted. This is likely because the advisory committee structure was a well-known entity to the Minneapolis city government – the city has over 50 volunteer-based boards, commissions and advisory committees. Formal public-private partnerships were less
prevalent, but still very much within the grammar of the city administration. Because people who were involved in the campaign continued to be involved in this committee, it represented an opening of having a more established role and an “in” when it came to energy politics. Additionally, actors from EVAC and allies pushed for language on equity and environmental justice in the city’s energy vision statement that at least officially serves as the basis for the work of the partnership.

Many on EVAC are in some way energy professionals, with a few environmental justice organizers. People apply for the board and are selected by the planning team to cover representation across expertise, geography, and demographics. Their positions are voluntary. 

And yet, as one person described it to me, the structure of partnership is like an hourglass, with the board with decision makers on top, and EVAC the advisory committee on the bottom. All communication between the two is funneled through the planning team. That person saw it as a hugely inefficient system, where additionally, because of the sensitivity of utility members, a huge amount of time would be spent on language about what we will do rather than actually doing it. So, the structure also places barriers to movement, and to movement intervention. 

c) Council members and council and city staff have been differentially involved and willing to push the utilities over the course of the Partnership. The balance of power in the council in first years led to the strongest advocate for change being sidelined as an alternate. With shifts in the council in 2017, the city has become more willing to challenge. 

An advocate described the role of utility members on the board as keeping its impact on its larger business model as small as possible, but staff on the planning team whose main forum of work is the partnership often have tried to do what they can to move the utility and improve communication. 
";4;4;3;Off;4;5;3;Off;3;5;4;Off;5;5;4;Off;5;5;4;Off;4;5;5;3;2;Off;Off;2;2;5;5;Off;Mostly confident;"a) During the campaign phases, interactions were very collaborative, building an alternative, strategic intervention point, and plan to move residents and the council. 

In the transition to the Clean Energy Partnership (CEP), instead of municipalization which was seen as unrealistic, the city chose to take a harder line with the utilities and use some of the pressure that the campaign had built up towards negotiations. Originally city officials thought that they could get clean energy commitments in this space – that wasn’t the case legally, but they did limit the length of the franchise agreement, which would potentially give them more leverage against the utilities down the road. 

The goal of advocates then re-framed to getting the city involved in energy decision making, shifting who is involved in decision making around energy, and shifting the location, process and scale of those decisions. The campaign's demands also created the climate in
which there was pressure on the utilities to agree to concessions. 

This option of a partnership was seen as more legible and reasonable to city and utility actors, to a large extent because of the pervasiveness of discourses of neoliberal governance. Private actors continue to be seen as experts with more capacity to implement change, even though most of the changes coming out of the partnership have been developed and funded by the city. 

The CEP itself is very formalized with 4 meetings a year, but did lead to a dramatic increase in communication between staff members of the 3 institutions through their involvement in the planning team. The workings of EVAC were somewhat less formalized but also with only 4 meetings per year, with working groups between meetings that often did the bulk of work. 

A large part of shifts, pressure, accountability, and policy ideas, that have come through CEP have come through the presence and role of EVAC. EVAC was credited, for instance, with the largest discernible impact of the  Partnership - the franchise fee increase that provided a source of funding for (ideally equity centered) city energy work. Multiple people mused on the role of having an advisory board that is to a good extent made up of energy professionals, which makes it be seen as a group that is more “expert.” In relation to other boards at the city, it forwards more of its own policy suggestions, versus commenting on things brought to them by staff. This isn’t because of structural reasons, more the mix of people and the work they are willing to take on. One element of this is having several key members of EVAC who are also involved in Community Power work, and are using EVAC to a decent extent as a vehicle to do so. These individuals also have a unique positionality, in that they are both energy experts and deeply committed to energy equity and democracy, a combination that is not always present. This combination does enable their voices to be taken more seriously, in a way that would not be considered democratic. The other side of this is that some members of EVAC thought they were asked to do too much, especially as a volunteer board. One member characterized this as “pro bono consulting.” 

b) The work of the board is determined by 2 year work plans with different work items and annual reports. EVAC has some degree of influence but it's not always codified or consistent. 

c) The partnership changed the terrain of engagement on energy in the city, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it has been successful in advancing the city or the campaign’s goals. It has provided a way where city officials more regularly engaged with the utilities, and themselves began to become frustrated with either their inability to change their business model or their work to block even relatively moderate proposals for change. Through taking on this new scope of work, these changes have started to create the city as a new actor in energy politics – municipally, but also in state-level institutions.";2;4;5;Off;4;4;3;Off;2;4;4;Off;2;4;4;1;2;3;Off;Off;4;4;2;Off;4;4;1;Off;3;2;5;4;1;3;4;4;2;2;3;1;Off;Off;Off;Off;Mostly confident;"a) The goals of the campaign were formulated in campaign literature and visions, and educational presentations about the utility structure that the group presented to neighborhood and community organizations and to city residents in house parties. One successful goal was making energy visible as something that was political, something the city and its residents could have control over and benefit from. It made the concession process visible as a point in which the city could exercise its political pressure and not just rubber stamp the status quo.

The goals of CEP were formulated through a new Energy Vision document that came as a response to the campaign, which included energy equity and reducing disparities as prime goals. These stacked upon the already formulated goal of Minneapolis' Climate Action Plan which was finalized earlier in 2013. The partnership was formed around Memorandums of Understandings the city signed with each utility, along with new (shorter) franchise agreements, and work plans that were formed out of that that lasted for 2 or later for 3 years. The campaign had background influence on the content of the MOU priorities but the first years were more just about getting the partnership up and running and a lot of analysis and mapping in all sectors. Utilities reported progress on energy reductions from and participation in their legally mandated energy efficiency programs, and the first more involved board level discussion (end of its first year, 2015) was on establishing metrics for the partnership work. 

The areas of work were categorized under: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (community wide and municipal use); Energy use (residential and commercial/industrial); Renewable electricity (community wide, municipal use, and proportion local/direct purchased). Earlier plans concentrated more exclusively on a breakdown of various types of buildings for efficiency programs (more or less the city helping the utilities on their mandated goals) along with municipal operations. Later items were added on workforce development, and on inclusive financing (an on-bill option that allows low-income people and renters the ability to pay for energy efficiency upgrades from their savings, without loans). There are annual reports from the Partnership, which however were reported to take up an inordinate amount of its work and staff time to complete. 
  
b) Annual reports and (sometimes heated) discussions of what constitutes a work plan item and progress by the utilities from the city's perspective has been one major area of accountability. The other has been EVAC - many points of intervention, especially in the early years of the partnership, were initiated by EVAC. These included studies about what constitutes effective community engagement, and initiatives to find a source of energy-related funding (raising the franchise fees; the utilities claimed their regulatory structure prevented them from funding anything that went to only one part of their service territory). EVAC has also asked for a larger role in work plan development and on spending decisions for this new energy money (~3 million/year), but has had inconsistent results depending on shifting leadership. Currently they have larger roles and regularly are non-voting participants at CEP meetings, but that role is not formalized. Community Power, the organization that was formed out of the MEO campaign, has been one consistent source of identifying policy drivers and helping push for them through EVAC.   

c) Utilities have had to navigate more interests and factors in making decisions, but relative power hasn’t shifted towards giving the city a direct bearing on those decisions, or on the values forwarded through them. For instance the utilities, particularly Xcel, have realized the increased
importance of cities to their businesses, but have found more ways to placate and stall than to change, at least on issues of decision making power and market share.

It created a new forum (CEP and EVAC) with an increased role for social movement pressure/intervention, and a forum in which the city itself could become politicized/more aware of energy utilities. 

In limited ways it's allowed the city of Minneapolis to act as a lever: 1) changes the utilities make for it will likely affect their whole service territory; 2) by activating the city’s political force in energy fights, much more pressure can be built up at the legislature or regulators (mixed results but promising). To differing extents, it's altered the strategies (but not not always policies) of utilities.

It has led to better data and monitoring tools from the utilities, and some concrete but rather small changes by the utilities: LED streetlights, EV infrastructure for the city itself, the gas utility testing CCS. GHG emissions of the city enterprise have lowered considerably, and Xcel has reduced its GHG electric footprint, but this has been made up for in increases in natural gas and travel emissions. Many changes the city effected itself through its own rule making capacity - for instance energy disclosure ordinances that should help renters and homeowners account for utility costs in making housing decisions. There have similarly been improvements on uptake of energy efficiency upgrades due to financing of audits by the city and more wrap around services by utility service providers, but not nearly reaching the partnership's goals. Xcel has blocked or ignored its commitments to inclusive financing. Most shifts from the partnership have come through the city as opposed to utilities, and most of those initiated by EVAC. 

b) The institutions talk much more to each other and have on the one hand more open dialog about solutions, but on the other more frustration about blocking even moderate change, taking maximum credit for the smallest amount of change, forum shopping of the utilities to avoid agreements made with the city, or just the inability to reduce energy use or emissions, especially from natural (fracked) gas. Collaboration seems most successful in leveraging resources for existing utility energy efficiency programs, but utilities tend to block anything that poses a major change to this work (opening possibilities to low income people), and the scale of the work does not meet goals, except for municipal operations themselves. 

c) It seems clear that the partnership model won’t lead to changes in utility business models in terms of releasing some of their market share to the city or other actors that could forward different values, or towards other goals like democratization of utility decision-making or decommodification. At most it has led to input and sometimes influence of community voices, on the edges.

One large change is that it is likely that pressure from the campaign and the city has moved Xcel towards accelerating its renewable and decarbonization goals. However Xcel is still holding onto both nuclear and fossil gas, and is continuing to use its political power to hamper decentralized
decision-making and ownership. CenterPoint, which as a company has much less leeway to decarbonize, has been relatively more cooperative with the city on working on energy efficiency and inclusive financing. It however is not showing any signs of addressing its business model, which is based solely on fossil gas, a fuel source with a limited lifespan, and instead is trying to push hydrogenization and ""renewable"" natural gas, technologies that are as yet unproven or have unclear carbon reductions due to their reliance on industrial ag.
Major barriers to local and community action on ownership, remunicipalization, and renewables remain in state law and in the regulatory arena. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
